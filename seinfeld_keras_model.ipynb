You come by, you open up the lid and theyll (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing.

They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall.

You havent been out of the building in ten yearsKESSLER Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, Do you mind) Are you done with thisJERRY No.KESSLER When youre done, let me know.JERRY Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.KESSLER I thought I wasnt allowed to be in here this weekend.JERRY No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin.

(to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets goJERRY The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cottonballs. This is the one Im always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cottonballs, were all human beings, what is the story Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cottonball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cottonballs, ladies What are you doin with them The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little ziplockbaggy of cottonballs over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin withJERRY Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinkingGEORGE What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.JERRY You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.GEORGE Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.JERRY Really HowGEORGE Cause its all in the greeting.JERRY Uhhuh.GEORGE All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.JERRY Right.GEORGE You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.JERRY Lip area.GEORGE You know a hug definitely good.JERRY Hug is definitely good.GEORGE Sure.JERRY Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apartGEORGE Thats so brutal, I hate that.JERRY You know how they do thatGEORGE Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.JERRY Shake is bad, but what if its the twohander The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyesGEORGE Hand sandwich.JERRY Right.GEORGE I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.LAURA Guess whoJERRY Hey, hey.LAURA  JERRY HeeeeyJERRY Its good to see you.LAURA Hi.JERRY This is my friend George.LAURA Hi, how nice to meet you.GEORGE Hi, how are youJERRY This is Laura.GEORGE Laura, sure.JERRY (to Laura) I cant believe youre here.GEORGE  JERRY Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.LAURA Oh, thank you.JERRY (aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, GeorgeGEORGE Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.JERRY So uh, what do you thinkLAURA Ooohhh, wow This place isnt so bad.JERRY Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything Uuhhh, bread, water...saladdressingLAURA (laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wineJERRY Uh, yeah, I think I do.LAURA (referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this downJERRY Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.LAURA Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible  and if its not, fine  for me to stay here tomorrow night tooJERRY Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow Are you, are you doin anythingLAURA No, Id love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that Im right open.JERRY Really What would you like to doLAURA Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but Id just love to go on one of those fivehour boat rides around Manhattan.JERRY (unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.JERRY (answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.LAURA (to the phone) Hello... Hi... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, Im gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes its fine... No, were goin on a boat ride... Dont be silly... Im not gonna have this conversation... Look, Ill call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged.JERRY (not excited) Youre engagedLAURA You, you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. And Im on this emotional roller coaster.JERRY Youre engagedLAURA You know, I cant believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of we. Ugh, its a very stressful situation.JERRY (matteroffactly) Youre engaged.LAURA Yeah, yeah, hes a great guy...JERRY Yeah.LAURA Youd really like him, you know, I cant wait to get on that boat.JERRY Me tooJERRY I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want We want women, thats it Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking carhorns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The carhorn honk, is that a beauty Have you seen men doing this What is this The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. Eeeehh, eehhh, eehhh This man is out of ideas. How does it... Eeeeeeehhhh I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.JERRY So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...AUDIENCE Cheque.JERRY Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at allJERRY Whats that oneELAINE Coccoon II The Return.

Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.ELAINE And he happens to be pretty good lookin.JERRY (pause) All right, sir.ELAINE And... hes hilarious.JERRY Now thats not fair So where did you meet this guyELAINE I staked out his health club.JERRY Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plantJERRY Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okayJERRY So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt itJERRY Is that it Got the cue tips, got the miniumbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. DoneELAINE (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.JERRY (proudly) I am...the master packer.ELAINE (laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.JERRY What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.ELAINE (raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...JERRY Yes.ELAINE Just gimme your keys.JERRY All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off Jerry presses the first button to the intercom) GeorgeGEORGE (from the intercom) Yeah.ELAINE Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this placeJERRY Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.ELAINE Okay, this is quite a place.JERRY Theres more. The refrigerator.JERRY Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clearELAINE Ill eat out.JERRY One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.GEORGE (to Jerry) ReadyJERRY Yeah, one sec.GEORGE Hey, Elaine.ELAINE Hi.GEORGE Coming to the airport with usELAINE No, Im staying here for the weekend.

Its two bedroomsJERRY Two bedrooms Why do I need two bedrooms I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.ELAINE You oughta at least take a look at it.JERRY Really WhyELAINE Cause then I could move in here.JERRY Ohhhh...ELAINE Its time you got outta here anyway.GEORGE Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.ELAINE Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...GEORGE Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.ELAINE Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.JERRY Like this You just said you wanted to live here.ELAINE Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.GEORGE Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or notJERRY I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.JERRY Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINEELAINE (from the bathroom) JERRY (Elaine enters the livingroom.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back.

You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony It could be the Penguin.

And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it Well no, he didnt call BANG (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.GEORGE I love the mirror in that bathroom I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.JERRY Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettinGEORGE I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs out. Coffee out. French fries out.

Ill never feel comfortable.GEORGE Oh, get outta here.JERRY How can I ever have you over Youll sit there moping.GEORGE I wont mope.JERRY Youre already moping Would you take the placeGEORGE No, impossible Its your apartment.JERRY You found the place.GEORGE You won the choose.JERRY All right, forget it, its over, Im not moving.GEORGE Well, me neither.JERRY DefinitelyGEORGE Definitely.JERRY Alright, then just get rid of it.

Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillipshead You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there Yeah, thatll hold.GEORGE I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.JERRY I dont think you did anything wrong.GEORGE I told her I liked her. Why Why did I tell her I like her I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.JERRY We can only thank God for that.GEORGE Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.JERRY Youre imagining this. Really.GEORGE Oh, no. No no no no.GEORGE Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.JERRY What floss WhenGEORGE We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.JERRY Ah, mint.GEORGE Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..JERRY So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.GEORGE If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.JERRY And youre sure the floss was the catalystGEORGE Yes, I am.JERRY You dont think it mightve had anything to do with thatGEORGE What You dont like thisJERRY It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.KRAMER (to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer.

No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my nextdoor neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him I hate just being handed a phone.KRAMER Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.JERRY Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.KRAMER Well, why notJERRY He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.GEORGE What do you mean Wednesday I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench What happened Were not goingJERRY Were going. Thats next Wednesday.GEORGE Oh. Who is this guyJERRY His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so selfinvolved.KRAMER Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...JERRY Can you conduct your business elsewhereKRAMER (ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.GEORGE I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.JERRY I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once Hes got the attention span of a fiveyearold. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.GEORGE I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.JERRY What can I do Break up with him Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.GEORGE No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.JERRY Just break up with himGEORGE Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.JERRY The Truth.JERRY As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigeratorJOEL ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man.

Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.JERRY Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this How could this be They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this foodJERRY I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.GEORGE I never heard him say anything really funny.JERRY But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.GEORGE You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.JERRY Why Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of EarthGEORGE I dont know. But he aint funny.ELAINE I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.JERRY No problem.ELAINE I dropped a grape.GEORGE PardonELAINE I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.JERRY Were you crying I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.ELAINE No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...JERRY Robert.ELAINE Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.GEORGE Guys with cats... I dont know.JERRY Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeingELAINE Vanessa.JERRY Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.GEORGE Oh, no.

Thats a dating decathlon.ELAINE (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.GEORGE Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over thereJERRY You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.GEORGE Up again This is incredible Im.. Im getting it.ELAINE Youre getting whatGEORGE A stock.JERRY What stockGEORGE Did you ever meet my friend, SimonsJERRY Maybe.GEORGE He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.JERRY How highs it suppose to goGEORGE I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do itJERRY Boy...

Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.JERRY George What Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong... So, what are we gonna do... Great... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.JERRY So you dont know whats wrong with himGEORGE All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.JERRY Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with himGEORGE Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.JERRY Well, this is it. Im selling.GEORGE Just give it a little more time.JERRY I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.GEORGE All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.JERRY WhereGEORGE To the hospital.JERRY The hospitalGEORGE Im going to find out whats going on. All rightJERRY Are you nuts You dont even know the guy.GEORGE So what Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.JERRY What if hes in an iron lung or something What are you gonna do (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.)

I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.DRY CLEANER When did you bring it inJERRY Whats the difference Look at it Do you see the size of this shirtDRY CLEANER You got a receiptJERRY I cant find the receipt.DRY CLEANER You should get the receipt.JERRY Look, forget about the receipt, all right Even if I had the receipt look at it Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with thisDRY CLEANER Yes, but how do I know we did the shirtJERRY What do you think this is a little scam I have I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.DRY CLEANER Maybe you asked for it to be washed.JERRY No Drycleaned.DRY CLEANE Let me explain to you something, okay With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causingJERRY You shrunk it You know you shrunk it Just tell me that you shrunk itDRY CLEANER (looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it.JERRY I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. ThRight Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up Theres a lot of shirts todayJERRY Bless you.ELAINE Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway Huh What do they do Because theyre clean I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.JERRY  So what are you gonna doELAINE I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of catsJERRY Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a catELAINE What do you think, Jerry You wanna make twentyeight bucksJERRY Im no cat killer.ELAINE How about we go over there right now and we shave themJERRY Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.ELAINE He actually went to the hospitalJERRY Yeah.ELAINE Oh man, hes nuts.JERRY Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.KRAMER How much are you down altogetherJERRY I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.KRAMER Wow.JERRY You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.KRAMER Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.JERRY I really dont need to look.KRAMER What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.JERRY Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.KRAMER Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.JERRY What What Did you go down there (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen (George shakes his head.) How long were you thereGEORGE Fifteen seconds.JERRY You told him you knew SimonsGEORGE Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.JERRY Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.ELAINE Didnt work, huhGEORGE (laughs) Not quite.ELAINE WeWell, what are you gonna do about the stockGEORGE Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.JERRY So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.VANESSA I know. You mentioned it.JERRY Oh yeah, right.JERRY (thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work And Ive still got another day Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind itVANESSA No, its got a little battery.JERRY Well, thats good.JERRY (thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager Do you want me to see if we can get another roomVANESSA No, its okay.JERRY So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charmingVANESSA Not especially.JERRY Well, what do you want to do this afternoonVANESSA What can we do Its raining.JERRY We cold play Sorry We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearingVANESSA Oh, youve never heard of it.JERRY No, what What kind is itVANESSA I cant tell you.JERRY (thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business sectionVANESSA That stock I thought you got out of thatJERRY I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points (to Vanessa) Its up six pointsVANESSA I told you not to sell.JERRY You did not tell me not to sell.VANESSA I said the market fluctuates. RememberJERRY Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollarsVANESSA Thats probably why we'reJERRY WhatVANESSA Forget it.JERRY No, what Thats probably why..VANESSA Thats probably why were staying here, because you lost money on the stock.JERRY (thinking) So, what am I looking at here Twentynine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...GEORGE (laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessertJERRY  Im good, thanks.GEORGE Elaine, get something Its all taken care of.ELAINE Im kinda full.GEORGE So dont finish it.JERRY (acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all toldGEORGE I dont like to discuss figures.JERRY How muchGEORGE I dont know, what Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.JERRY So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital nowGEORGE  No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.ELAINE Oh god.JERRY Is that still from the catsELAINE No, I just have a cold.JERRY So, what ever happened with thatELAINE I gave him an ultimatum.GEORGE He chose the catsELAINE Theyre very clean animals.JERRY I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.ELAINE Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.GEORGE I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...ELAINE Superman can go back in timeJERRY We went over that.GEORGE Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.JERRY A robot butcherGEORGE Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money she turns to leave George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me juspeek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...JERRY Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.JERRY Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me For my life Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there Could I get in over here Could I get in there Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen Will it start moving backwords, I wonder I mean, is that possible That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.GEORGE She cant kill me rightJERRY No, of course not.GEORGE People break up all the time.JERRY Everyday.GEORGE It just didnt work out. What can I do I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.JERRY You tried.GEORGE I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love herJERRY Did you tell her you loved herGEORGE Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.JERRY Youre a human being.GEORGE And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do Say no (laughs) I cant do that to someone.JERRY Youre too nice a guy.GEORGE I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do Not do anything I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.JERRY Youre flesh and blood.GEORGE I had nothing to do wtih any of this I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.JERRY I told you when I met her.GEORGE My back is killing me.JERRY You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.GEORGE Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.JERRY Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.GEORGE Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person Cant I do it over the phone II have no stomach for these things.JERRY You should just do it like a BandAid. One motion Right offELAINE Hi.JERRY Hi.ELAINE Hey, what are you doingGEORGE Im letting you in.ELAINE Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.GEORGE No, you wont.ELAINE Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.GEORGE Okay.ELAINE Why cant you sit in the middleGEORGE Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.ELAINE Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent yaGEORGE Is it that obviousELAINE Hello, Jerry.JERRY Hello.ELAINE Did you get a haircutJERRY No, shower. So, where are we eatingELAINE Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist He went from nods to nothing.GEORGE (singing imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...ELAINE And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.JERRY A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.GEORGE I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.ELAINE ReallyGEORGE Yes.ELAINE You would do thatGEORGE If I was a different person.JERRY Hello... Hello. Is Glen there... Im sorry. Is this 8055553234... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...KRAMER (to the intercom) Come on up.JERRY (to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again to nobody) Why Why do they just hang up like that Thank you very much.KRAMER Taste this.JERRY No, I just had a sandwich.KRAMER No, taste it. Taste it.JERRY I dont want cantaloupe now.KRAMER Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...JERRY I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...KRAMER ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.JERRY ...all rightKRAMER Uhhuh. Its goodJERRY Its very good.KRAMER Good, huhJERRY Good.KRAMER I got it at Joes.JERRY Uhhuh.KRAMER Fortynine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.JERRY Its too far.KRAMER Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..JERRY Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief Put stockings on and roll em down below my kneeKRAMER See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.JERRY I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.GEORGE Im outta there. I did it Its over.JERRY You did it What happenedGEORGE I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.JERRY Uhhuh...GEORGE I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it Youre doing it And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang Son of a boom I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumpedJERRY See, its never as bad as you imagine.KRAMER I liked Marlene. Whats her numberGEORGE Uh, no, I, I dont think so.JERRY (to Kramer) Could you stop that smackingKRAMER George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.GEORGE Oh no, thank you.KRAMER Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.GEORGE No, really. No, no, thanks.KRAMER Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.JERRY Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves to George) So thats it Youre outGEORGE Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.JERRY So, go get them.GEORGE Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.JERRY So forget about the books. Did you read themGEORGE Well, yeah.JERRY What do you need them forGEORGE I dont know. Theyre books.JERRY What is this obsession people have with books They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read itGEORGE Theyre my books.JERRY So you want me to get the books Is that itMARLENE ...so, it mustve been ninetyfive degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and tshirt. And I dont know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.JERRY So whatd you doMARLENE Well, nothing. Its no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didnt see what the big attraction was.JERRY Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.MARLENE Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I dont see each other anymore, it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends.JERRY No.MARLENE Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled.JERRY I dont know how this happened.GEORGE Jerry, its not my fault.JERRY No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you reread those books yet, by the way You know the great thing When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentenceGEORGE It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machineJERRY (disgusted) Ohh You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...JERRY  GEORGE I dunno sometimes...GEORGE What trying to get off the phoneJERRY (more disgusted) Ohhhh You cant Its impossible Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.GEORGE Just do it like a BandAid. One motion. Right off (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you thinkJERRY Yeah. Yes, she is.RECEPTIONIST Mr. CostanzaGEORGE Yeah.RECEPTIONIST The doctor will see you now.GEORGE (to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.JERRY The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this Are you kidding Are they really gonna do that to him Are there seats Can we get in Do they scalp tickets to these things I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...JERRY So, how was itGEORGE I was in there for two minutes.

How was I to know she had a pony Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony Do you know what the odds are on that I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony.

And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.ELAINE I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your gameJERRY Two FortyFive.ELAINE And what times the funeralJERRY Two o clock.ELAINE How long does a funeral takeJERRY Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took fortyfive minutes.ELAINE So you cant do bothJERRY You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mahjongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.ELAINE How can you even consider not goingGEORGE You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen I just dont see how it could occur.ELAINE You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.GEORGE They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.JERRY I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How What can I do thats not wasting itELAINE Is this a waste of time What should we be doing Cant you have coffee with peopleGEORGE You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.ELAINE He has to go. He may have killed her.JERRY Me What about you You brought up the pony.ELAINE Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.GEORGE (to Jerry) Whos going to play left fieldJERRY Bender.GEORGE Bender He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.ELAINE Maybe shes there in spirit. How about thatGEORGE If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean ParkwayELAINE George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.GEORGE You know how easy it is for dead people to travel Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.JERRY Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.ELAINE Phoenix Whats happening with his appartmentJERRY I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.ELAINE Three hundred a month Oh, my God.EULOGIST Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.JERRY Well, the games starting just about now.HELEN It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.NEPHEW Im not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. Im just an intern. I cant write a note to an airline.MORTY Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.JERRY I just wanted to say how sorry I was...UNCLE LEO Jerry, you wanna hear something Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside  so hell completely revamp that operation, you understandJERRY Yeah.UNCLE LEO Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.MORTY You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.JERRY Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.ELAINE Oh, me too.ISAAC Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad.ELAINE So, I understand youre moving to PhoenixISAAC Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya wouldve liked Phoenix.ELAINE Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartmentISAAC Of course its very hot there. Ill have to get uh air conditioner.ELAINE Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End AvenueISAAC Although they say its a dry heat.ELAINE Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartmentISAAC I dont even know if I should take my winter clothing.ELAINE I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.ISAAC Oh, the apartment. Jeffreys taking the apartment.ELAINE Oh, Jeffrey.JERRY You know JefferyELAINE  Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.HELEN Its raining.JERRY Its raining Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.MORTY Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.NEPHEW I cant. Ill get in trouble.MORTY Oh, for Gods sakeGEORGE Who gets picked off in softball Its unheard of.JERRY Its never happened to me before.ELAINE I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the baseJERRY Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.GEORGE And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop flyJERRY I thought there were two outs.ELAINE I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.JERRY  It was the single worst moment of my life.GEORGE (smiling) What about Sharon BesserJERRY Oh, well, of course. Nineteenseventythree.ELAINE Makes you wonder, though, doesnt itJERRY Wonder about whatELAINE You know... (looking up) the spirit world.JERRY You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on meELAINE I never saw anyone play like that.JERRY But I went to the funeral.ELAINE Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.GEORGE Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.JERRY Dont you think she woulda heard I was thereGEORGE Not necessarily.JERRY Who figures and immigrants gonna have a ponyJERRY What is the pony What is the point of the pony Why do we have these animals, these ponies What do we do with them Besides the pony ride. Why ponies What are we doing with them I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.JERRY I hate clothes, okay I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. Onepiece silver jumpsuit, Vstripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.JERRY  I think Ive seen enough.SALESMAN Well, I might have something in the back.ELAINE The back They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.JERRY Why dont they open up an entire store for the back Call it, Just Back. All back No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.CUSTOMER Oh, I just read that. Thats terrific.JERRY (pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.CUSTOMER Alton Benes is your fatherELAINE Yeah.CUSTOMER I always felt he deserved a wider audience.ELAINE Im not so sure he wants one.ELAINE Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay You and George are coming, right Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.JERRY I guess Im coming. I mean...ELAINE What What, you dont want to go nowJERRY No, Ill go. Im going.ELAINE No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...JERRY Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.ELAINE So, thats why were not together anymore.JERRY What is thisJERRY This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.ELAINE Try it on.ELAINE Wow, this is soft suede.JERRY This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.JERRY How much is itELAINE (shocked) Oh my God.JERRY Bad (Elaine nods.)

Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.JERRY Okay, take it.KRAMER Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.GEORGE (singing) Master of the houseDoling out the charmReady with a handshake and an open palmTells a saucy talkLoves to make a stirEveryone appreciates a...JERRY What is that songGEORGE Oh, its from Les Miserables.

When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.GEORGE Can I say one thing to you And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.JERRY Absolutely.GEORGE Its fabulous.JERRY I know.GEORGE And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it Four hundred Five hundred Did you pay five hundred for this (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six Cant be seven.

Thats for damn sure.GEORGE Its uh, it's only a few blocks.JERRY (to the intercom) ElaineELAINE Yeah.JERRY Come on up.KRAMER Hey.JERRY Hey.KRAMER Ive gotta feed the birds.JERRY SoKRAMER You got any of those mini RitzesJERRY I cant believe I do.KRAMER Yeah Well, are you going outJERRY Yeah.KRAMER Hey, wheres your new jacket (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to itJERRY I was out in the snow last night.KRAMER Dont you know what that does to suedeJERRY I have an idea. (Elaine enters to Elaine) We can make the ninethirty at Cinema Three.ELAINE Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.JERRY Is he still in townELAINE No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.KRAMER So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one nowJERRY I dont know.KRAMER (smiling) Well...ELAINE (to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.JERRY ReallyKRAMER You gonna throw this outJERRY Well, I cant wear it.ELAINE Yeah, he like you though.

Now, why does moisture ruin leather I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here Is it suede I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I gotJERRY The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm Have you seen them We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jetskiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.GEORGE (excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line Thats what I looked like.JERRY So you didnt askGEORGE No, I froze.JERRY Counter.GEORGE Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A halfhour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.JERRY He said wussGEORGE Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.JERRY So you called.GEORGE Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.JERRY Yeah. Like a farm boy.GEORGE Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic HiJERRY Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful.GEORGE Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.JERRY All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.GEORGE So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday nightJERRY AndGEORGE She bought.JERRY Great day in the morning.GEORGE Then I got off the phone right away.JERRY Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.GEORGE Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.GEORGE I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.CAROL You do not.GEORGE Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.JERRY (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.DONNA Thats Irish.JERRY Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassieCAROL So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.GEORGE Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.CAROL Would you like to come upstairs for some coffeeGEORGE Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.CAROL (confused by his response) So, um, okay.GEORGE Okay.CAROL Goodnight.GEORGE Yeah, take it easy.DONNA Thanks again for the movie.JERRY Youre welcome.DONNA Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.JERRY Oh, thats okay.DONNA Unless you want to go to your place.JERRY Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.GEORGE (frustrated) Take it easy Huh Take it easyJERRY I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.DONNA Values are very important.JERRY Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night You wanna have dinnerDONNA Thursdays great.JERRY Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna I dont feel comfortable in them.DONNA Are those Cotton DockersJERRY Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.DONNA Really I like that commercial.JERRY You like that commercialDONNA Yeah, its clever.JERRY Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and wittyDONNA Yeah, thats the one.JERRY What could you possibly like about thatDONNA I dont know. I like the, guys.JERRY Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.DONNA  Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.JERRY Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants Doesnt that bother youDONNA (annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.JERRY But theyre talking about nothing.DONNA Thats the point.JERRY I know the point.DONNA No one is telling you to like it.JERRY I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to beJERRY Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my lifeJERRY Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercialELAINE I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.JERRY No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reasonELAINE Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.ELAINE Hi.JERRY Youre still thinking about thisGEORGE She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.JERRY She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.GEORGE She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.ELAINE Maybe coffee was coffee.GEORGE Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.ELAINE Well some people drink coffee that late.GEORGE Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twentyfour hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.ELAINE Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.GEORGE I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.ELAINE Oh, why I love it when guys call me the next day.GEORGE Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a takecharge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.ELAINE All shell think is that you like her.GEORGE That's exactly what I'm trying to avoidELAINE Well, she wants you to like her.GEORGE Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like meELAINE I dont know what your parents did to you.KRAMER Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a lifeanddeath situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.KRAMER So you gonna use itJERRY  I dont think so.KRAMER Its funny.ELAINE It is funny.JERRY I like to use my own material.KRAMER Thats as good as anything you do.GEORGE All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.JERRY Why do we have to leaveGEORGE Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.ELAINE Oh, see, this is the problem.JERRY Youre kicking me out of my houseGEORGE Yes.ELAINE (encouraging) Dont forget.GEORGE (to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any applesJERRY Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.CAROL (from the phone a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.GEORGE Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.JERRY Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you callGEORGE Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.JERRY What did you sayGEORGE I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots onJERRY After one date you try and improvise on her machineGEORGE Now Im in the worst position of all.ELAINE Yknow, my brotherinlaw once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.GEORGE He did thatELAINE Yeah.GEORGE Somebody did thatJERRY Shell call you back. Youre overreacting.JERRY Not once.DONNA NeverJERRY I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.DONNA Thats amazing.JERRY Thank you.DONNA Is there anything else about you I should knowJERRY Yes, Im lactose intolerant.DONNA ReallyJERRY I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.GEORGE Wait till you hear this (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.DONNA Wait, wait.

Oh, youre the one that likes that commercialDONNA He told you about thatGEORGE (backpedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...DONNA (to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.JERRY What (to George) What did, what did you sayGEORGE Say What Nothing, I...DONNA You told him how I like the commercial.JERRY Well, so what if I said thatDONNA Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.JERRY No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.GEORGE (to Donna) Why did you have to get me in troubleDONNA I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.GEORGE Boy oh boy.JERRY I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So whatDONNA I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.JERRY Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.KRAMER Hey.JERRY Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.KRAMER Oh.

Today.JERRY WhatGEORGE She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her.

You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that Bang You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like thatJERRY Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Everytime I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.JERRY What did you doKRAMER Mousse. I moussed up.ELAINE I guess it was just a matter of time.KRAMER You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My premousse. And now, I begin my postmousse.

(audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.JERRY (to Kramer) To the right.GEORGE That took awhile.JERRY Dont get up.GEORGE Id like to help, but my neck..GEORGE So how long has it been in the basementJERRY Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it.

I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments.

Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. Hello, Mom yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies. So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want[Setting Jerry's apartment]TV VOICE (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied.

And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.GEORGE (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my faceTOR No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.JERRY (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.GEORGE (Still on the hot water) What about shavingTOR (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I (Reaches over, and touches George's face)GEORGE I guess so.TOR (Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung.

(Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.ELAINE It's almost stupid if we didn't.JERRY It's moronic.ELAINE AbsurdJERRY Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.ELAINE We, there are always a few.JERRY I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.ELAINE Devastating.JERRY Because this is very good.

But this cannot be disturbed.ELAINE Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.JERRY But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.ELAINE Huh.JERRY For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.ELAINE Right.JERRY But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.ELAINE Well why should that be Oh, I have an idea.

Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.JERRY And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.GEORGE Boy, these are really bad details.JERRY It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.GEORGE Oh I hate to hear this.

It can't be done.JERRY I think we've worked out a system.GEORGE Oh, you know what you're like You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.JERRY No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.GEORGE Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.JERRY Okay.

If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.JERRY I never should have made up those rules.GEORGE What is it about sex that just disrupts everything Is it the touching Is it the nudityJERRY It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.GEORGE You know what this means I can't see her anymore either.JERRY WhyGEORGE It's break up by association.

And that.JERRY And the other.KRAMER Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)[Setting Night club]JERRY Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, Rerun, don't wanna watch it..  What are you watching I don't care, I gotta keep going. Who was that I don't know what it was  doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going. Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel. You see Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had storytellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty storytellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, Alright start telling me a story, what's happening I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about Is there a girl in that story ..No Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed.[Setting Coffee shop]GEORGE (Shocked) She's pregnant Leslie is pregnant Oh, see, there is no justice.JERRY She's the performance artist, rightGEORGE (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist.

He's a third cousin, or something.ELAINE By marriage.JERRY Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick  trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.GEORGE That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.ELAINE Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.GEORGE What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent womenJERRY Thin ice, George. Thin ice..GEORGE (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.ELAINE She stopped performing.GEORGE (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.JERRY (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy He holds a grudge like Khomeini.GEORGE She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her performances.JERRY Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrityGEORGE God She's cooking dinner for God She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.ELAINE It was an accidentGEORGE Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling  I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. What kind of chocolate was that Do you throw any other foodsJERRY (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.GEORGE And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else Never even, never even said goodbye Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt.JERRY What ever happened with the shirtGEORGE I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.ELAINE I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.JERRY Asked you You're not going to do that are youELAINE anyone else, never. But, Leslie  I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.GEORGE Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.JERRY Ask not what I can do for you  ask what you can do for me.GEORGE (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.ELAINE Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys What is this fascination Who cares It's all so boring..GEORGE She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's babyELAINE (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.GEORGE Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.ELAINE See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..JERRY ButELAINE My roommate has Lyme disease.JERRY Lyme disease I thought she had EpsteinBarr SyndromeELAINE She has this in addition to EpsteinBarr. It's like EpsteinBarr with a twist of Lyme disease.JERRY How did she get Lyme diseaseELAINE I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.JERRY They still do that playELAINE It's a classic.JERRY With all the nudityELAINE I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the lovein.GEORGE (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye.

Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are theyELAINE I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.JERRY 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women  and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom And entire buffet is swept off the table.GEORGE Someday, before I die, mark my words  I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.JERRY And if you doGEORGE I still won't be able to forgive myself  but at least it won't be about this.[Setting Jerry's apartment]KRAMER What are you doing this for Look at you..JERRY Quiet.

They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..KRAMER No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventyfive games on cable this year..JERRY (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.KRAMER You won't regret it.

I might be the last person you ever see.[Setting Night club]JERRY I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that.

I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here.[Setting George's car]GEORGE Sounds like a rough trip.JERRY Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway.

So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...JERRY This could only happen to you.GEORGE So I finally stop and say, Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left.JERRY You said this to her after.GEORGE No. During.JERRY Oh, boy.GEORGE Yeah.JERRY Wow So...GEORGE So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the BatSignal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she'sELAINE I hate this place.

(Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have  without realizing it  been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.KRAMER (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.GEORGE This is a guy I know.. Kramer.KRAMER Habla espanolGEORGE (To himself) Oh my God.ANTONIO Si.KRAMER Como se dice.. waterbedGEORGE (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.KRAMER You got anything to drink AguaGEORGE Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.KRAMER Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)GEORGE Hurry up.ANTONIO (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita Pequita (Starts to panic)KRAMER His cat's gone.ANTONIO (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta (To Kramer and George) Who left the door open (Silence) Who left the door open (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on Help me look (All three head out the door to look)[Setting Antonio's apartment]KRAMER ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things inGEORGE (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp.KRAMER The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.GEORGE (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)KRAMER You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)[Setting Jerry's apartment]JERRY (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.KRAMER Hey.JERRY (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.KRAMER It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.JERRY (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.KRAMER Oh How do you figureJERRY (Into phone) How do you figure (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.KRAMER Why was I in charge of closing the doorJERRY (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after himKRAMER SoJERRY (Into phone) So (To Kramer  getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the doorKRAMER Let me talk to him.JERRY (To Kramer) Talk  call him from your house.

Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow No problemsJERRY Guarantee ..Hey, it's a car.ELAINE Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it  because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.JERRY (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week togetherELAINE I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that pingJERRY There's no ping. Why are you so wackyELAINE Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his gutsJERRY So, you two been, uh..ELAIEN No I told him I've been having my period for the last five days I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..JERRY What's your airport routeELAINE I've got it all mapped out  I'm taking the tunnel.JERRY ..What about the Van WyckELAINE I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.JERRY Oooh.ELAINE Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, rightJERRY You still using that old alarm clockELAIEN Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything  it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.[Setting Night club]JERRY Flying doesn't make me nervous  driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land. (Imitates cannon operator) I'm sorry, where you goin' Chicago (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.[Setting Elaine's apartment](Elaine and Ed are in bed. Elaine awakes to find out that it's 9 15  they overslept. She gets frantic)ELAINE (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up The alarm clock didn't go off (Shakes him) It's 915 You're gonna miss the plane It's 915ED 915ELAINE Yes 915ED (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.ELAINE Tomarrow Are you crazy No, now, now Let's go (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed Get dressedED Can I showerELAINE Shower ARe you out of your mindED I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.ELAINE Forget the shower The shower's out. Move it Put your clothes on Put your clothes on (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you goingED The kitchen.ELAINE The kitchenED I've got a bag of cashews in there.ELAINE They're not making it Let's get your pants onED What's the big deal if we don't make it I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.ELAINE No You have your ticket You have to go nowED I'll never make it.ELAINE Don't say thatED But it takes fortyfive minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.ELAINE Shut up and packED And what if I don't make the plane You'll have already left. Then what will I doELAINE You're talking too muchED Where's my sweaterELAINE WhatED My brown sweater.ELAINE What What sweaterED My brown sweater.ELAINE You didn't bring a brown sweater.ED I brought a brown sweater.ELAINE Here Here You want a brown sweater (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweaterED That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.ELAINE It's brown (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)ED What are you doingELAINE NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)ED My shoes. You packed my shoes.ELAINE Shoes Shoes Shoes Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century People walked around for thousands of years without them (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go[Setting Jerry's apartment]JERRY Anywhere in the cityGEORGE Anywhere in the city  I'll tell you the best public toilet.JERRY Okay.. Fiftyfourth and SixthGEORGE Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name  she'll give you the key.JERRY Alright.. Sixtyfifth and Tenth.GEORGE (Scoffs) ARe you kidding Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.ELAINE (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this  I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that fivecarpileup on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.KRAMER ..The busboy's coming The busboy's comingGEORGE The busboy's comingJERRY You don't mean hereKRAMER Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..GEORGE He's coming up (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.JERRY Where are you goingGEORGE I'm the one he wants He's coming to settle the score.JERRY (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.KRAMER No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.GEORGE Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..KRAMER Antonio. In hereGEORGE (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it goingANTONIO Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)GEORGE (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..ELAINE (Into the intercom) YeahED It's Eddie.ELAINE He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..ANTONIO And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before  and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)ED Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head offANTONIO Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay 'Cause you bumped into meED Who do you think you're talking to, palANTONIO Hey, get your hands off meED Go to hell[Setting Coffee shop]JERRY He'll get another job. He's a busboyGEORGE It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.JERRY It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.GEORGE That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.ELAINE Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.GEORGE So, much longerELAINE Till when  till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himselfGEORGE (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.ELAINE Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)GEORGE I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.JERRY Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing[Setting Night club]JERRY First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is  you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident They get out, Didn't you see my signal Look at that fender ..Then you'd see a real fight.JERRY EvryEvery time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. Oh, is he good Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best. They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher. And then there's always that, Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me. Why What's the difference He's a doctor. What is it, Oh, you know Bob Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving TicTacs.JULIANNA ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.JERRY What do you think the worst part of being blind isJULIANNA Excuse meJERRY You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would beJULIANNA I don't know.JERRY I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.JULIANNA Well that's how my fiveyear old eats. He's a very picky eater.JERRY You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in PennsylvaniaJULIANNA No.JERRY He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.JULIANNA Oh.JERRY Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.JULIANNA (visibly uncomfortable) Have you seen any good moviesJERRY Who takes care of your boy during the dayJULIANNA We have a woman. WhyJERRY No no. I'm just saying.JULIANNA She had references.JERRY Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge em.JERRY (about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.JULIANNA I don't live near here, ya knowJERRY So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.ELAINE I don't like to talk during a massage.JERRY Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.GEORGE Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.ELAINE Oh I forgot to tell youJERRY I'm in the middle of a story.ELAINE Oh, okay, go ahead.GEORGE Why don't you ever go shoppingJERRY Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.ELAINE What happenedJERRY Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.ELAINE Oh, wasn't that terribleJERRY Yes, it was.GEORGE Not even an apple.ELAINE She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.JERRY I know it was stupid.ELAINE Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)JERRY Hey, I just said it was stupid.GEORGE What about this leftover Chinese foodJERRY Take it.ELAINE I can't believe you said that.JERRY Hey, would you stop it alreadyELAINE So, whatd she sayJERRY I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.GEORGE (he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)ELAINE I have a good masseuse you could go to.JERRY Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.GEORGE Physical therapy is covered by insuranceJERRY Yeah.GEORGE You don't have to pay for the massageJERRY Not if you have a doctor's note.ELAINE So where do you get this noteJERRY Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.GEORGE Right, your friend Roy.ELAINE What's the name of this physical therapistJERRY I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.GEORGE And you don't have to pay.GEORGE We have a, threeo'clock appointments.RECEPTIONIST George and Elaine, rightELAINE Right.RECEPTIONIST Could you fill these out for me please And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing JuliannaELAINE (quietly) Ok.RECEPTIONIST And George, you'll be with Raymond.GEORGE Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'RECEPTIONIST Yes.GEORGE But, uh, Raymond is a man.RECEPTIONIST That's right.GEORGE I can't get a massage from a man.ELAINE Why notGEORGE What, are you crazy I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.ELAINE No, I don't want the man either.GEORGE What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.ELAINE He'd just be touching your back.GEORGE He'd just be touching your back too.ELAINE No, it could get sexual.GEORGE I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.ELAINE I wouldn't be comfortable.GEORGE I would What if something happensELAINE What could happenGEORGE What if it felt goodELAINE It's supposed to feel good.GEORGE I don't want it to feel good.ELAINE Then why get the massageGEORGE ExactlyRAYMOND GeorgeGEORGE YesRAYMOND I'm Raymond. (with a big smile)GEORGE Hello.(with not a big smile)RAYMOND Are you ready (smiling, he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome Raymond.)RAYMOND And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.GEORGE Really.RAYMOND Use to be a flight attendant.GEORGE Oh boy.RAYMOND Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.RAYMOND So what do you doGEORGE WhatRAYMOND I said, 'What do you do'.GEORGE II don't know.RAYMOND You don't know what you doGEORGE Nah.RAYMOND Ohhho, come on.

It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.JERRY Okay, so what if it movedGEORGE That's the sign The test if a  if a man makes it move.JERRY That's not the test.

He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.KRAMER Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.GEORGE I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.JERRY I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.KRAMER Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone elseJERRY He can have a donut,KRAMER Yeah.JERRY but not at Dinky.GEORGE I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.KRAMER Look I'm tellin (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.GEORGE The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts.

It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.JERRY A mental institutionKRAMER You know what they do in there Did you see CooCoo's Nest They put those electrodes in your head.GEORGE It's not really a mental institution.

You can't change that.GEORGE What I said I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.JERRY It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbookGEORGE You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.PATRICE You mean thatGEORGE Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.JERRY He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.PATRICE Papers Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem.

At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean Then they can pull them out one by one and go Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail[Setting Night club]JERRY I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets You need trunks son I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks. Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit You bump into somebody you know No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back.[Setting Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents]HELEN (looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 730.

(snapping his fingers)[setting night club, closing monologue]JERRY Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going.JERRY So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas We're flyingGAVIN Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, fortyfive countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.JERRY Is he on the plane nowGAVIN Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me.

We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me. But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeetJERRY Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'JERRY Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971 ... This is a joke right What are you From a radio stationKRAMER entersJERRY Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.KRAMER What's the problemJERRY This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.KRAMER Do you know how much that comes to That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be 50,000JERRY It doesn't work like that.KRAMER If it's a dime a day it could be 100,000JERRY It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...JERRY That orange dress is burned in my memoryKRAMER Oh, memory burn.JERRY I wonder what ever happened to her.KRAMER How did they ever find youJERRY Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.JERRY It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the libraryKRAMER You know I never got a library card.JERRY (to speaker) Coming down.KRAMER It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,JERRY I gotta go to the library. You want to goKRAMER Yeah,KRAMER The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.JERRY Where's GeorgeREADER Shhh.KRAMER Tryin' to save a quarter.JERRY I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.JERRY This woman's completely ignoring me.KRAMER Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.JERRY Eventually a little shot of penicillinLIBRARIAN YesJERRY Yeah I called before.

You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.JERRY What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ...

Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.JERRY Look, Mr. Bookman. II returned that book. I remember it very specifically.BOOKMAN You're a comedian, you make people laugh.JERRY I try.BOOKMAN You think this is all a big joke, don't youJERRY No, I don't.BOOKMAN I saw you on T.V. once I remembered your namefrom my list.

Y'know that little stamp, the one that says New York Public Library Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again.

Come with me.JERRY But...SECURITY GUARD Come on.JERRY (STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...KramerJERRY I've had this condition since I was eleven I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.SECURITY GUARD Well you're still not allowed.JERRY Do you hear what I'm saying to you I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying forSECURITY GUARD That's up to you.JERRY So you don't care if I die.SECURITY GUARD What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.JERRY It was life and death.SECURITY GUARD Uh huh.JERRY Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger I know it's against the law.SECURITY GUARD I don't know.JERRY Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why...Do you think I enjoy living like this...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.JERRY (C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.SECURITY GUARD You can tell the police all about it.KRAMER (CALLING OUT) JerryELAINE JerryGEORGE Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back.

We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.ELAINE No, no, I'll be back.GEORGE Oh what's the difference We'll all be dead eventually.KRAMER Does that bother youGEORGE Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother youKRAMER Not at all.GEORGE See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother youKRAMER I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.GEORGE Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to doJERRY First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.SECURITY GUARD I know what you did.JERRY Oh really, do you Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.JERRY (CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.SECURITY GUARD Yeah I'm sure.JERRY You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.ELAINE And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.MAN 1 I can't do it.ELAINE But why Why can't you do itMAN 1 I can't.ELAINE No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.MAN 1 That's right.ELAINE But why Why don't you want toMAN 1 I don't know.ELAINE But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone outMAN  1 No, I wouldn't.JERRY (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their fortyseventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at sixfifteen.JERRY (CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.KRAMER The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundredfifty pounds.GEORGE (NOT INTERESTED) Really.KRAMER What does he do with all that fat Does he just jump up and down on it Does he gouge it like Killer KowalskiGEORGE Who's Killer KowalskiKRAMER He was a wrestler.

GEORGE HereKRAMER (SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.GEORGE Don't you believe me It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him.

I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.JERRY Stop being so concerned with looks.JERRY Have you said anything to her about itGEORGE I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.JERRY Alright, shut up, here they come.GEORGE (waving) How can I not think about it Look at the size of this thing.KRAMER So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me.

Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.GEORGE What, you didn't wash all dayKRAMER Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.AUDREY It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.KRAMER Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.ELAINE KramerKRAMER What WhatELAINE How could you say something like thatKRAMER What What do you mean I just said she needs a nose job.ELAINE No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose I'm so sorry, Audrey.AUDREY No, it's ok.ELAINE What did you have to say that forKRAMER Well, I was just trying to help out.ELAINE Yeah Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.KRAMER You see what happens when you try to be niceAUDREY Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking aboutGEORGE Thinking Nothing. What could I possibly be thinkingAUDREY You look like you've got something on your mind.GEORGE Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind.

Yeah, he's quite a character.AUDREY So, what did you thinkGEORGE About the pizzaAUDREY No, about the nose job.GEORGE Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you thinkAUDREY Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.GEORGE Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.AUDREY I know, they're good.GEORGE Peter Jennings had one.AUDREY ReallyGEORGE Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...AUDREY Uh huh.GEORGE It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.AUDREY I hate the dentist.GEORGE It's a cleaning.AUDREY So you really think I should do thisGEORGE If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.AUDREY Well, maybe I should.GEORGE What the hell.ELAINE (barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose jobGEORGE Me I didn't say anything.ELAINE You encouraged her to get one.GEORGE I didn't encourage. No encourage.ELAINE Peter Jennings had oneGEORGE It's possible.ELAINE Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.AUDREY No, George is right. I want to get one.ELAINE I think it's a mistake.GEORGE Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.GEORGE I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.JERRY Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.GEORGE (checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.JERRY We have time.GEORGE It's exciting, isn't it She's gonna have a whole new face.JERRY It is exciting.GEORGE Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...JERRY Please, please, Isabel She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.GEORGE You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.JERRY Then whatGEORGE He still wins but it's not a blowout.JERRY She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.JERRY (holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.KRAMER (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.JERRY So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.GEORGE Good for you.JERRY I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.GEORGE It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.JERRY It's not like that at all.ELAINE How do you even know the jacket is thereKRAMER Well I don't, I'm guessing.GEORGE Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began.

I said to him, what do you call this most beautiful fabric, and he said they call it cashmere. I repeated the words cashmere, cashmere. I asked if I could have it, and he said No. Get away from me. Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.GEORGE I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.CLEANING WOMAN Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.GEORGE Take it off.

Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.DICK It's off the wagon.JERRY In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to townDICK I don't know.JERRY On the wagon.

It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correctGEORGE Who said thatMR. LIPPMAN She did.GEORGE Was that wrong Should I have not done that I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.MR. LIPPMAN You're fired.GEORGE Well you didn't have to say it like that.MR.

I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.DICK You mean on the wagon.JERRY Don't get smart.KRAMER All right, Coney Island.

I'mCYNTHIA There's just no men out there, you knowELAINE I know.CYNTHIA I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.ELAINE I hate the good ones.CYNTHIA Is Jerry one of the good onesELAINE That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.CYNTHIA Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me and eventually I just go, You're right.ELAINE You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.CYNTHIA No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.GEORGE I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.JERRY Oh, so there's still hope.GEORGE I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.JERRY Oh, so hopelessness is the key.GEORGE It's my only hope.CYNTHIA See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do.

Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.ELAINE I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.JERRY George too.JERRY AND ELAINE (together) Yeah, right.JERRY I've never fixed anybody up.ELAINE Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.JERRY Well why wouldn't you start with George You think she's too good for GeorgeELAINE I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'JERRY Well you implied it.ELAINE I didn't say it.JERRY Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong.

Bald above the eyes And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.JERRY Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.ELAINE He can really do thatJERRY Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.ELAINE What, are you into thisJERRY Yeah, come on, it's a good match.ELAINE No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.KRAMER Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day  like the Zabruter film  with the Umbrella man and everything  Oh so brilliant parody] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says,  Nice game pretty boy.. Keith continued past us up the ramp.NEWMAN A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.ELAINE What was itKRAMER He spit on us.... and I screamed out, I'm hitNEWMAN Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.ELAINE Wow What a story.JERRY Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.JERRY Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.NEWMAN Well that's the way it happened.JERRY What happened to your head when you got hitKRAMER Well. uh, well my head went back and to the leftJERRY AgainKRAMER Back and to the leftJERRY Back and to the left Back and to the leftELAINE So, what are you sayingJERRY I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.ELAINE So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.JERRY But that is not what they would have you believe.NEWMAN I'm leavin'.

But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.JERRY Nice looking Lugar.JODI I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.KRAMER Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'BrienDAN ElaineELAINE Dan Oh, hi Dan, how are youDAN Good.ELAINE Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.DAN Oh, KramerELAINE What's going onDAN Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neonazi rally.

The Paramount, right next door.ELAINE Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.DAN Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.KRAMER WhoDAN The head of the Aryan Union O'Brien.JERRY What's taking him so long out thereGEORGE Didja see the way she was looking at meJERRY She's a Nazi, George. A NaziGEORGE I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.JERRY Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna doGEORGE I don't know.JERRY Let's just make a run for it.GEORGE I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.JERRY How'd that happenGEORGE I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.JERRY I know, why do they make that bed so tight You gotta sleep with your feet like that.GEORGE For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.GEORGE 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in QueensGEORGE Astroturf You know who's responsible for that, don't you The Jews Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.TIM We'll be ready in a minute.GEORGE Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.TIM With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.GEORGE Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or meTIM You are.GEORGE And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular againTIM You are.GEORGE Good.

Now get out.GEORGE Okay, what are we gonna doJERRY I don't know.GEORGE Alright, how's this We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.JERRY Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.KRAMER I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.ELAINE I'm sure he was just joking around.KRAMER Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. YesELAINE What is itKRAMER Don't you see There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you The limo The name The rally at Madison Square Garden Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan UnionELAINE Jerry's a naziKRAMER I can't believe I didn't see it.ELAINE Listen, you idiot Just calm down I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.KRAMER You don't think so.ELAINE No, he's just neat.TIM You know it's funny.

He's Murphy to a fault.TIM Where are you fromJERRY Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.TIM Sounds more like Scottish.JERRY We were right on the border.KRAMER Maybe he's with the company.ELAINE WhatKRAMER The CIA Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.ELAINE What about his comedy actKRAMER That's the perfect cover All that time on the road Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.ELAINE What about GeorgeKRAMER What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed KennedyELAINE I'll bet they were even in on it.KRAMER Alright, what are we gonna do I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.ELAINE Kramer, you're hurting meGEORGE Those are my friends I was telling you about.

(takes phone) Hello (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.KRAMER O'Brien Well that's weird.EVA (gun drawn) Who are youJODI A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.JODI They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.EVA Get outELAINE Look, it's Dan Hi DanDAN ElaineELAINE HeyGEORGE I am not O'Brien I am not O'Brien I'm not O'Brien Ask anyone Jerry JerryELAINE You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speakerJERRY It's safer Plus it's more annoying to the other person.JERRY Oh look at this guy.ELAINE What's goin' onJERRY Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission.

(In a cowboy voice)ELAINE Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.JERRY Wait, he stopped, he's parking.ELAINE What What I can't hear you. JerryJERRY Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin highbeam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.JERRY So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.GEORGE Boy What a story I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.JERRY You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.JERRY He, he, he.

Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)ROBIN You went out with a bullfighterELAINE Yes, well, an exbullfighter now.MICHAEL Wow.ROBIN What was his nameELAINE His name Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.GEORGE Pass the salt please.ROBIN Where did you meet himELAINE Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use Fighting Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.GEORGE Bread.ELAINE I just love meeting new people.

He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.GEORGE I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrongJERRY The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you' Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.ELAINE It's me.JERRY Come on up.GEORGE Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.JERRY No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.GEORGE Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.JERRY What if she's having an off nightELAINE HiJERRY Hi.ELAINE Well If it isn't mister gesuntheitGEORGE Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.GEORGE Ah, shut up.ELAINE What does it mean anyway 'God bless you'.

On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.ELAINE Are you actually considering thisGEORGE I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicableELAINE Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.JERRY Yeah.KRAMER Hey, you know who owns that carJERRY What carKRAMER The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.JERRY Yeah whoKRAMER That blond across the street.

Eight... Nine... Ten. dingJerry's standup So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering  are there keys to the plane Do they need keys to start the plane Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again. They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system...Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I  I left the keys to the plane in my apartment. You see the technicians all running underneath the plane you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet hideakey under the wing...maybe he left it up there somewhere...Opening scene Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.JERRY's brain What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty Do dreams require liquid It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.JERRY's brain What the hell... Why is the door openJERRY Kramer, what are you doing hereKRAMER Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up Y'know, I was watching Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, and I  y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.JERRY You scared meKRAMER It's just me.JERRY That's enoughKRAMER Forgot the popper...

(He angrily storms out. Kramer then reenters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)JERRY So put 'em in a safe place.ELAINE I will.JERRY WhereELAINE I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upsetJERRY I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.ELAINE Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.JERRY I can't.ELAINE (mouths the words) Is that Kramer (Jerry nods.)JERRY Who's thereKRAMER (in hallway) Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...ELAINE Oh, I'm not, uh...KRAMER No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke the covenant of the keys.ELAINE Jerry, give him the keys back.JERRY Elaine...KRAMER I don't want the keys back No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.JERRY Take the keys.KRAMER I don't want the keys (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)JERRY O.K.KRAMER Now, one more thing  I would like my keys back.JERRY Your spare setKRAMER That's right.JERRY You want 'em backKRAMER Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.GEORGE Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.KRAMER Say yes Yes, George. YesGEORGE Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys... Because Elaine has my keys.KRAMER Well, you can get 'em back.GEORGE I suppose I could.KRAMER Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner Oh  much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.GEORGE MeKRAMER Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.GEORGE Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)WAITRESS Hi, are you ready to order (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George) Do you ever yearnGEORGE Yearn Do I yearnKRAMER I yearn.GEORGE You yearn.KRAMER Oh, yes.

Not little boys.GEORGE WhyKRAMER I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.GEORGE Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.KRAMER No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.GEORGE These pretzels are making me thirsty That was one line You got firedKRAMER I know, I know, but man I never felt so alive Now, are you coming with meGEORGE Uh, no, I'm not.KRAMER Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us  we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)GEORGE You're not really gonna go to California, are youKRAMER (points to his head) Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)GEORGE Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.ELAINE Just 'cause you have his keys Why does he need yoursGEORGE I don't know. He said he wants to be my key brother.ELAINE That's ridiculous.GEORGE (shakes huge keyring) That's Kramer.ELAINE I'll give you back your spare keys  but now I want mine back.GEORGE What forELAINE 'Cause.

Can I please have mine to give to back to KramerELAINE Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing Would you just put that down (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.JERRY Did you bring the keysGEORGE Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.JERRY This could be an emergencyGEORGE You never should have taken away his keysJERRY I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)GEORGE How'd the Mets doJERRY They lost.JERRY KramerNEWMAN (startling them) Hello, boys.JERRY Hello, Newman.NEWMAN You lookin' for someoneJERRY Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the moodNEWMAN Coy I'm not being coy.JERRY (to George) Is he being coyGEORGE Yeah, coy.JERRY You're being coy.

I got witnesses.JERRY Turn around, George.GEORGE Sure. (Turns around.)NEWMAN GeorgeJERRY Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way (Hits wall with his fist.)NEWMAN Help HelpJERRY Where's KramerNEWMAN HELP (Elaine enters.)ELAINE What's going onNEWMAN They're gonna beat me upGEORGE No we're not.JERRY We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.NEWMAN You wanna know what happened to Kramer I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right  about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.JERRY Bad rapNEWMAN Yeah. From you.JERRY MeNEWMAN You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. LaLa Land. L.A.JERRY L.A.JERRY I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it I had no choice He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see itELAINE Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.JERRY HuhELAINE What...JERRY No, what'd you sayELAINE Nothing. I didn't say anything.JERRY Oh, you didn't see it.ELAINE Yeah, I saw it. I saw it I did, I saw it. Yep.JERRY I heard you say something, there.ELAINE I didn't say anything.JERRY I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello Hello, Mrs. Kramer Mrs. Kramer Could you turn the music down Could you turn the music downGEORGE Ask her about Kramer.JERRY She's drunk out of her mind.JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine) Elaine Are you there It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you I'm at the coffee shop.KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine) Hey You ever been in an accidentBIKER About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet  came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean (Kramer yells.)JERRY (applauding) Georgie Boy Way to come through with the keys Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.GEORGE Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.JERRY Don't feel right What are you talking aboutGEORGE Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you inJERRY What is the big dealGEORGE Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.JERRY First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.GEORGE Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.JERRY Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)GEORGE Nope, no can do.JERRY George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physicalGEORGE Do you wanna fightJERRY Do you wanna fightGEORGE I'll fight ya Not the face Not the face (The struggle continues.)KRAMER And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.HIPPIE 1 Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.KRAMER Yes And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.HIPPIE 1 Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huhKRAMER Oh, he's cold.HIPPIE 1 Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife)  I'D STAB HIM I'D CUT HIM IN HALF I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN That's what I'd doKRAMER Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me hereHIPPIE 1 Hey, what's the rush, manKRAMER Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.HIPPIE 1 Hey, Kramer  have you ever killed a manKRAMER What do you think, junior You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid (mimics choking somebody)HIPPIE 2 Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer Please, Kramer (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)JERRY Don't you see You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.GEORGE You're right, how did I miss that (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.JERRY What's thatGEORGE Nothing.JERRY I heard something.GEORGE Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)KRAMER So, how long you been drivin' this thingWOMAN Goin' on four years.KRAMER Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.WOMAN Nothin' (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweettalker.KRAMER You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.WOMAN You want to give it a tryKRAMER ReallyWOMAN Do you know how to doubleclutchKRAMER Yeah.WOMAN Well, come on (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' doubleclutch.)GEORGE They were in here, I saw her put 'em in hereJERRY Well, this is great.GEORGE Well, what do they look likeJERRY They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) What do they look like.GEORGE Well, they're obviously not here.JERRY Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.GEORGE Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartmentJERRY (looking through some papers on the desk) What is this Murphy BrownGEORGE WhatJERRY By Elaine BenesGEORGE WhatJERRY Elaine's writing a Murphy BrownGEORGE Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)JERRY Wait a second (They fight over the paper.)GEORGE Gimme halfJERRY All right, hereGEORGE Why didn't she tell usJERRY (making fun) Elaine is writing a sitcom...

(Gives the keys to Elaine.)JERRY (to Elaine) And I don't want you to hold mineELAINE Good I won'tJERRY Good Don't Are these my keysELAINE These aren't my keysGEORGE Whose are theseELAINE I don't knowELAINE I just thought I could write it.JERRY Is that something you want to doELAINE I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.JERRY Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work You don't just write a Murphy Brown. You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.ELAINE O.K., can I just watch the show (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.JERRY What did you sayELAINE I didn't say anything.JERRY I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine It's Kramer Kramer's on Murphy BrownELAINE (laughing) Kramer's on Murphy BrownJERRY Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the deskCANDICE BERGEN Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.KRAMER Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.CANDICE BERGEN And you are...KRAMER Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.CANDICE BERGEN Snell.

So what happenedGEORGE Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.CORBIN BERNSEN So you killed the cat.GEORGE That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A.

Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a great case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.HELENA He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.GEORGE WENDT It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show.

That's a good one, Stu.JERRY Yeah, it's one of my favorites.RUSSELL What about you, George Have you written anything we might knowGEORGE (Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an offBroadway show, La Cocina. ..Actually, it was offoffBroadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.JERRY Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef  what was his nameGEORGE Pepe.JERRY Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.SUSAN Oh, he actually cooked on the stageGEORGE No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.RUSSELL So, what have you two come up withJERRY Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myselfGEORGE (Interrupting) May IJERRY Go ahead.GEORGE I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.RUSSELL NothingGEORGE (Smiling) Nothing.RUSSELL (Unimpressed) What does that meanGEORGE The show is about nothing.JERRY (To George) Well, it's not about nothing.GEORGE (To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.JERRY Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.RECEPTIONIST Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.RUSSELL I'll call back.GEORGE (Attempting to spell his last name) DALRIMPELRUSSELL (Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.GEORGE Is it with a yRUSSELL No.SUSAN What's the premiseJERRY ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an exgirlfriend, which is all true.GEORGE Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.RUSSELL You read You read on the showJERRY Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.RUSSELL All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of storiesGEORGE Oh, no.

That's a show.RUSSELL (Confused) How is that a showJERRY Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.GEORGE No, no, no. Nothing happens.JERRY Well, something happens.RUSSELL Well, why am I watching itGEORGE Because it's on TV.RUSSELL (Threatening) Not yet.GEORGE Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) RightJERRY (To Russell) How about this I manage a circus..JERRY I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking What was going on in your mind Artistic integrity Where, where did you come up with that You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.GEORGE . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.JERRY Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting Is that the woman you're talking aboutGEORGE Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.JERRY IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATEGEORGE Why Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.JERRY Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.GEORGE Wait a minute let me call Susan.JERRY No, no this is more important.GEORGE She might be leaving to work any minute.JERRY No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.GEORGE No.ELAINE What is itDR. RESTON I was just thinking about this patient of mine.ELAINE WhatDR. RESTON Just wondering if he's taking his medication.ELAINE Well, come on we're on vacation.JERRY Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)KRAMER Yeah (to buzzer)GEORGE (OC) It's George.JERRY And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.KRAMER Whoa, back up a second.JERRY Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.KRAMER Why would you think I would invite himJERRY I just a ssumed, ...KRAMER Assumed Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.GEORGE Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.JERRY Of course. How are youSUSAN Fine, it's good to see you.GEORGE And this is Kramer.SUSAN Hello.GEORGE All right go ahead Susan, tell him.JERRY Tell me whatSUSAN Well, I, (phone rings)JERRY Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second.

(Kramer throws up on Susan)GEORGE I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.JERRY I think SHE saw it coming.GEORGE You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.JERRY Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.GEORGE What, are you crazy It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.JERRY Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.GEORGE Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.JERRY What happened to youKRAMER Devola came after me.JERRY What Devola See I told you this guy is crazy.

Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this How did you get me to go along with that A show about nothingGEORGE It was a good idea. Susan liked it.

(Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn  grabbing a fistful) Listen, I  I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand  forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone. (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you..

(Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.[Setting The Ross' house]GEORGE The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) SusanSUSAN Uhh.. about the cabin..MR. ROSS (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times  she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) Cherish the cabin. Not, uh, Take care of your sister. (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, Cherish the cabin. (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.GEORGE (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.MR. ROSS WhatGEORGE S, uh, Superman  he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..MR. ROSS When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

ROSS (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burnedGEORGE (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..MRS. ROSS (Laughing out loud) Burned (George laughs with her)MR. ROSS Was anything found Was it all burned to the ground Did they find anythingSUSAN (Solemn) No. Nothing.MRS. ROSS (Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing Ha, ha, ha.GEORGE Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if  if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic  one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.[Setting Jerry's apartment]SANDRA (Offended) I can't believe you said thatJERRY WhatSANDRA (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to meJERRY What What You were the one who was talking dirty.

How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done.

I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that One bad impression, you're outta the businessGEORGE All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.JERRY What do you mean They know we're here.GEORGE I'll fake an illness.

(Pause)JERRY Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know...

An' stop calling me Nip (Coworker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.[Setting Susan's apartment building][Setting Calvin Klein's office]WOMAN About the focus group I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of selfconsciousnessKLEIN His buttocks are sublimeMAN Of course, his pectorals could use a little work  I suppose we could get him into the weight room.WOMAN (Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.MAN You've done it again, C.K.[Setting Calvin Klein office building]JERRY An' what if I did do it Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human If we pick, do we not bleed (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal[Setting Elaine's office]ELAINE I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you For I have seen the nipple on your soulGX So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself now how do I get out of this Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.JERRY The pickELAINE The pickGEORGE She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.JERRY I think I've seen that look.KRAMER I've got the magazine.

A night at the Improv. Jerry receives some disturbing news from the manager The show has been delayed.JERRY You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make itKERNIS I hear you, guy.JERRY And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material In the background is the plot complication of the week Buckles. The manager assures Jerry that Buckles isn't on the menu. He just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out.KERNIS Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spotJERRY No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie CheckMate'' at 1030.BUCKLES Hey, JerJERRY [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]GEORGE Excuse me, do you have a ticketMAN No.GEORGE Okay. Good. Misunderstanding number one When Jerry shows up at the other comedy place, the manager tells him his spot was for 915, not 950. The manager had no choice but to give Jerry's spot to...BUCKLES JerryJERRY What are you doing hereBUCKLES Hey, do you think this is funny Why do they call it athlete's foot You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete''ELAINE I've been dying to see CheckMate''.GEORGE Well, if it's as good as Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.ELAINE Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me I hated that movieGEORGE Ponce de Leon'' But that was greatELAINE Oh, come on. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked I mean, come on [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupidGEORGE Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek ... I lost it. Apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. Misunderstanding number two Kramer joins George and Elaine after looking for them at the Paradise Twin around the corner. Elaine hates the Paradise because it's a multiplex she'd rather see a movie on a big screen. Something catches Kramer's eye.KRAMER Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.GEORGE  ELAINE No, waitGEORGE You're not going to get back here in timeKRAMER I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinnerELAINE You can get a hot dog in the theater.KRAMER I don't wanna get a movie hot dog [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dogELAINE Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.KRAMER Well, just save me a seat.ELAINE No I don't want to save seats.

The movie has sold out. Real good, George. Real good.'' It's now 10 20, and Kramer suggests they go watch the 1045 showing of CheckMate at the Paradise. Elaine enters whine mode.ELAINE I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multitheaterGEORGE It's the same movie What's the differenceELAINE It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.JERRY [to taxi driver] Take the ParkBUCKLES No no no, take 55th.BUCKLES Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fishJERRY [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your pointBUCKLES I had a pointGEORGE Hey, you know what else is playing here Rochelle Rochelle''.ELAINE SighUgh.GEORGE I wouldn't mind seein' that.ELAINE Yeah.

What's the point of even discussing it [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then rereconsiders] I, I trust you.KRAMER Could you do me a favor If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okayELAINE No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ...

Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the scriptDANA Yes, yes I did.GEORGE (beaming) Well, what'd you thinkDANA (unenthusiastic) Uh...it was...good.GEORGE You didn't like itDANA Well, no, I GEORGE I can't believe this What was wrong with it What didn't you like about itDANA It wasn't funny.GEORGE It wasn't funny What, are you kiddingDANA No, I didn't find it funny.GEORGE You didn't find it funny This is what I'm paying forDANA Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler I didn't really buy that.GEORGE Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.DANA George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.GEORGE How's this for criticism Um...you stink. How do like that criticism You know what's funny to me That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of commeddee You sitting here, telling people what to do.DANA I think you'd better go.GEORGE Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freakGEORGE (immediately, to Elaine) So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is thatELAINE I guess she didn't think it was funny.GEORGE Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan  Martin We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employeeJERRY I thought your mother's paying for it.GEORGE And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.JERRY (to Elaine) You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me  what did you think of it You never told me.ELAINE What did I think of it (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)KRAMER (to Jerry) Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)JERRY (catches Elaine) Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.ELAINE Well, you know, I...KRAMER I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)JERRY You whatKRAMER Yeah, I kissed her.JERRY You kissed herKRAMER Right on the mouth.JERRY What kinda great friend are you How do you go from snubbing to kissingKRAMER Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I  mmm  I planted one (Laughs.)JERRY And what did she doKRAMER She kissed me back.JERRY I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand  why's she kissing youKRAMER (realizing) Because I snubbed her. You see Women, they like that Yes I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snubGEORGE No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)KRAMER (to Elaine) Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.ELAINE What Who told you thatKRAMER Gail Cunningham.ELAINE I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes Why are my shoes a topic of conversationKRAMER Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.ELAINE (angrily) How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's Did you hear this (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)JERRY So whatELAINE So what She is talking about my shoes She is discussing my shoes It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)ELAINE Hey GailGAIL Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...ELAINE Why are you talking about my shoesGAIL WhatELAINE My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.GAIL What are you talking aboutELAINE Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)WAITER Too spicy. He wants another one.

I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.JERRY Oh, Where did you eatRUSSELL Pfeiffer's.JERRY Ah. I know the chef there.RUSSELL Yeah. The food's usually terrific.GEORGE My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouillabase for a toilet.

(Jerry looks at George distastefully.)RUSSELL Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)JERRY WhatRUSSELL Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)JERRY WhatGEORGE Would you like a PeptoBismol I keep them in my wallet... (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)JERRY I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...GEORGE Pasta primavera.JERRY Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'GEORGE NoJERRY Yeah.RUSSELL (coming out of the bathroom) Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.GEORGE So, you were saying how, um...about the script...RUSSELL Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)GEORGE More jokesJERRY Another endingGEORGE A different name for the butler (Russell throws up again.)JERRY Maybe we should go.GEORGE We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)RUSSELL (from bathroom) Oh God. Oh my god.JERRY I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)MOLLY Hello.JERRY Hi.GEORGE Hi.MOLLY I'm Molly.JERRY Oh, I'm Jerry.GEORGE George.JERRY We're here discussing our script with your father.GEORGE He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)MOLLY Daddy Are you okayRUSSELL (from bathroom) Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)GEORGE So, you live with your mother, huhMOLLY Uh, yeah.GEORGE (to Jerry) Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.JERRY Uh huh.GEORGE Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)MOLLY Daddy, are you alright What's the matterRUSSELL It's just a stomach thing.MOLLY Yuck.RUSSELL (to Jerry and George) We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)GEORGE You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)RUSSELL (angrily) Get a good look, CostanzaJERRY What were you doingGEORGE Well, it's not my fault. You poked meJERRY You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.GEORGE It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here This is all I have in my life.JERRY Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.GEORGE All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage She's got nice cleavage.JERRY That's why I poked.GEORGE That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)GAIL Hey What is with your friend ElaineJERRY WhatGAIL She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.JERRY She didKRAMER Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.GAIL So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)GEORGE Pasta primaveraJERRY Is that what she said (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)KRAMER (to Jerry) She's somethin', huh She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.JERRY She isKRAMER She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)JERRY Hello Oh, hi Stu.GEORGE (lazily swinging the garbage bag around) From NBCJERRY (to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on What Really Oh my god....did he give you a reason...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)JERRY (to Elaine) If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.ELAINE Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen yearold's cleavage anywayGEORGE He poked meJERRY There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex  (mimics nudging someone with an elbow)  cleavagepoke, cleavagepoke...ELAINE But she was fifteen.JERRY You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.GEORGE Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...JERRY You know what we could do He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.GEORGE Hey, now you're onto something.JERRY The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a lowcut dress.GEORGE Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.JERRY No.GEORGE But...somebody like Gail, though.JERRY Ya.ELAINE What What do you mean, Gail (Kramer enters.)KRAMER Yahhey.JERRY Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.KRAMER Alright, I'll call her right now.JERRY Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)ELAINE (to George) What do you mean, Gail You don't think I can attract attention You don't think I can put asses in the seatsJERRY Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)KRAMER She said she'll do it.GEORGE Beautiful.JERRY Beautiful.KRAMER (points at Elaine's feet) But she wants the shoes.ELAINE WhatKRAMER She says she wants those shoes.ELAINE She wants my shoes What kind of person is this Alright She is not getting 'emJERRY No, come on I'll buy you another pairELAINE No, these were the last pair of these that they hadJERRY I'll get you another one just like itELAINE No, but these were the only really cool ones like this Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)GEORGE (to Elaine, in a somber tone) Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...ELAINE Oh yeah, because she caught you jer GEORGE Never mindELAINE Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same sizeKRAMER Alright, what size are youELAINE Sevenandahalf.KRAMER Eh Bingo.GAIL (hands a plate to another chef) Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)JERRY Hey Whattaya knowGEORGE Look who's hereJERRY Fancy meeting you hereRUSSELL Oh. Hello.GEORGE (notices Russell's lunch) Pasta primavera Back on the horse.JERRY You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.GEORGE Didn't hear anything...JERRY Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.RUSSELL Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a lowcut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you sayingGEORGE Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leerJERRY No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)ELAINE (to Russell) Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchupRUSSELL (not noticing Elaine's cleavage) Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)GEORGE Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)RUSSELL Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)ELAINE Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any troubleRUSSELL (still not noticing Elaine's cleavage) No.ELAINE (leaning forward) Do you have a...ketchup secretRUSSELL No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)ELAINE (flirtatiously) Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)RUSSELL (to Jerry and George, reconsidering about the pilot) Field of vision, huhGAIL How's everythingELAINE Mmmm.JERRY Really good.GEORGE This pasta primavera is fabulous.JERRY Very tasty.GAIL How'd everything go with that NBC guyGEORGE Great.JERRY The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...ELAINE You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a lowcut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.JERRY Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.ELAINE Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.GEORGE Well, it's a funny idea.JERRY It's funnyGEORGE C'mon, funny is funny.JERRY Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, rightELAINE Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.JERRY If you can.GEORGE Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the wayELAINE Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)JERRY I think what he's trying to say is, get the bouillabase. (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)ALLISON I don't want to live I don't want to liveGEORGE Because of me You must be joking Who wouldn't want to live because of me I'm nothingALLISON No... You're something.GEORGE You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no goodALLISON You're good. You're goodGEORGE I'm bad. I'm badALLISON You're killing meGEORGE So what could I do I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.ELAINE Over youGEORGE Yes.

She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.ELAINE Never even seen you Gotta kinda envy that...JERRY Y'know, you've been developing quite the acidtongue lately...ELAINE [Proudly] ReallyELAINE Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leaderJERRY Living or all timeELAINE All time.JERRY Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.ELAINE I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulleGEORGE Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.ELAINE I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.ELAINE Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.GEORGE So, whaddya say You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.JERRY [indignantly] What's the matter with youGEORGE [quietly] C'mon, go along...JERRY I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose stepping past me C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...JERRY Y'know I hear that all the time.ELAINE Hear whatJERRY That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.ELAINE Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.JERRY Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.ELAINE And you get along well with women.GEORGE I guess that leaves me in the clear...GEORGE I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.JERRY Oh yeah, what Buck NakedGEORGE Yeah, how did you know thatJERRY You told me that already like two months ago.GEORGE Allison bought it for me.JERRY How you gonna get out of that oneGEORGE I dunno.

Is that like the end of the world, or somethingSHARON So how did you two meetJERRY Actually, we met in the gym locker room.GEORGE Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.(George takes a hold of Jerry's leg to stress the point and Sharon, who obviously thinks she has a real story here now, asks another question )SHARON Do you guys live togetherJERRY [quizzically] Live togetherGEORGE No, I got my own place.(Jerry is about this close (picture my thumb and forefinger really close together) to figuring out what is going on here, when the question fatale is asked )SHARON And do your parents knowJERRY Know whatGEORGE My parents They don't know what's goin' on...JERRY Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I knew you looked familiarJERRY There's been a big misunderstanding here We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose We're not gay Not that there's anything wrong with that...GEORGE No, of course not...JERRY I mean that's fine if that's who you are...GEORGE Absolutely...JERRY I mean I have many gay friends...GEORGE My father is gay...SHARON Look, I know what I heard.JERRY It was a joke...GEORGE Look, you wanna have sex right now Do want to have sex with me right now Let's go C'mon, let's go baby C'mon(Not that that approach was going to work, or anything, but what minute chance they had of convincing her is blown away as the door bursts open and )KRAMER Hey, C'mon Let's go I thought we were going to take a steamGEORGE NoJERRY No steamKRAMER Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myselfKRAMER Happy birthday parubaJERRY Today's not my birthday.KRAMER Well, I beg to differ...JERRY Look at this A phone A twoline phoneJERRY Hey, where you goingELAINE I gotta go return something...SHARON Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.

I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.JERRY Y'know, I think I'll pass on the Guys And Dolls...GEORGE No. Just imagine her reaction.ELAINE Yeah...GEORGE Oh, my God...JERRY WhatGEORGE She hasn't seen the article When she sees it, she's gonna think I'm out baby I'm outALLISON Yeah SoGEORGE Yeah soALLISON Well this is nice.

Steeped in gayness.ALLISON [matteroffactly] I don't believe it.GEORGE You don't believe me Ask Jerry.ALLISON I will.GEORGE What do you mean you will That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.ALLISON [Grabs George's lapels] I want to hear it from Jerry...SHARON Oh, can you ever forgive meJERRY I dunno...

My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.ALLISON ReallyKRAMER We'll see you later...KRAMER He's the phone manKRAMER Not that there's anything wrong with that...I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife. But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth], they should vacuum Y'know I think Joe might be vroom [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little vrooom...GEORGE Oh, what's the point When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't likeJERRY Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll all be over...GEORGE Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.JERRY Yeah, how about a muteGEORGE A mute would be good.JERRY Ah, where you gonna meet a muteGEORGE This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.GEORGE I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...JERRY A deep, yawning chasm...GEORGE There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasureJERRY Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.ELAINE Hey boysJERRY Hey How you doin'ELAINE Good.

(points at the doctor.)DOCTOR Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.JERRY What do you meanDOCTOR I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection.

We top it off with one of our seven airfresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.JERRY Let's do it.HAIRDRESSER The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.ELAINE Tomato SauceJERRY Wait a minute It still smells It still smellsCARL It still smells.JERRY It still smellsGEORGE How could it still smell after all thatJERRY I don't knowGEORGE Well, what are you gonna doJERRY I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that carGEORGE You're selling the carJERRY You don't understand what I'm up against.

So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, noone can overrule me When you're married, you're part of a vast decisionmaking body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the presidentGEORGE Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody elseELAINE We don't walk that fast...GEORGE No seriously...ELAINE Seriously, we don't.GEORGE The better looking they are, the faster they go I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur.

Very talented, very takented young actress.ELAINE ReallyJERRY Yes.ELAINE Who is itJERRY She's an eskimo, actually.ELAINE Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)JERRY She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.ELAINE Listen, was Russell at the castingJERRY No, he didn't show up.ELAINE You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautifulJERRY No. No you're not.ELAINE Why do I keep setting you upJERRY I don't know.ELAINE (to the waitress) Could we get a little more (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh...

Who does all the hiring waitresses hereWAITRESS He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone.

Why should these women have all the advantages It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, tooJERRY Hey that's life. Goodlooking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.[setting doctor's clinic]GEORGE You see, It's right here. It's all white...DOCTOR Oh yeah. Yeah.

It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)JERRY Can't you at least die with a little dignityGEORGE No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity.

He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.FRED Anyway, go on.ELAINE Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job.

All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressureELAINE You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango leftThe female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.[Setting Jerry's apartment]GEORGE I can't believe this.JERRY Oh, it won't be for that long.GEORGE How can I do this How can I move back in with those people Please, tell me.

All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they thought he was flying. You know how children are, Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying And then, splat...GEORGE That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator SweedlerMRS. SWEEDLER Mrs. Sweedler's fine.GEORGE Mrs. Sweedler thank you. YYou see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.MRS. SWEEDLER How is thatGEORGE Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.MRS. SWEEDLER Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.GEORGE Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.Mrs. SWEEDLER (STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame.GEORGE Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.MRS. SWEEDLER Mr.Constanza.GEORGE Yes.MRS. SWEEDLER A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise GEORGE Yes.MRS. SWEEDLER ... and you greedily, callously want to profit from itGEORGE (PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..MRS. SWEEDLER Get out Get out, now Get out of my office.GEORGE Should I leave this..MRS. SWEEDLER GET OUTKRAMER Excuse me.

Don't the players know that we're there Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them To me tennis is basically just pingpong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30love. 30love. Sounds like an English call girl. That'll be 30, love...

Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting.

Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job.

Whatever you like.ELAINE Oh great, thanks Kramer.KRAMER You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.JERRY Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball boys, not ball men. There are no ball men.ELAINE Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.KRAMER Well there ought to be ball men.JERRY All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.

She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.ELAINE I beg to differ.JERRY Really.ELAINE He's the loser. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.JERRY Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.ELAINE Well we can take the car service from my office.JERRY ReallyELAINE Yeah, they don't know.KRAMER All right, I'll see you later.JERRY Okay.KRAMER (while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.GEORGE To the victor goes the spoils.

That couple is breaking up.GEORGE They're breaking up How do you knowJERRY She reads lips.GEORGE What are they saying nowLAURA It's not you, it's me.GEORGE (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.JERRY (Puts his hand over his mouth) WhatGEORGE (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.JERRY (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.GEORGE (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.JERRY (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.GEORGE (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.JERRY (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.JERRY Uh Laura, George was wondering if...LAURA Sure. I'll do it.JERRY So I really had a good time.LAURA Yeah, me too.JERRY So you want to go to the party on Friday nightLAURA Yeah.JERRY All right, we're taking a car service.

Are you up for itKRAMER Oh I'll be up for it punk.JERRY See I was saying six but she thought I was saying sex. We straightened the whole thing out though.GEORGE She confused six with sexJERRY Yeah.GEORGE Well if she can't tell six from sex then how is she going to lip read from across the roomJERRY Well six and sex are close.GEORGE It's two completely different sounds. ih and eh.JERRY Eh.GEORGE It seems like a problem.JERRY Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.KRAMER Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.JERRY You're kidding.KRAMER Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.GEORGE Oh, when is that car service comingJERRY In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.GEORGE If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be It's like having Superman for your friend.JERRY I know. It's like Xray vision.GEORGE If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.NEWMAN Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.JERRY Can't do it Newman.NEWMAN But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.JERRY It's not going to happen.NEWMAN (Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret.

(hits his arm on the desk) OwELAINE Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.JERRY Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.KRAMER Huh, Okay.NEWS Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.GIULIANI It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's nonfat.JERRY Nonfat yogurt Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.ELAINE (pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.JERRY Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.GEORGE Name tags Name tags What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.FRANK I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. Hello, Sam. How are you doing, Joe (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.GEORGE I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .ESTELLE Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.GIULIANI My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified nonfat yogurt.JERRY The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.GEORGE PhewELAINE Oh, it stinks.KRAMER Mine, too. I got one more day.JERRY I can't eat this.NEWMAN (from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.JERRY It had fat in it, it's not good for you.NEWMAN I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.ELAINE Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the nonfat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.JERRY So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.ELAINE I wonder what actually happened in that lab.KRAMER Yeah, me, too.NEWMAN I can't eat this.MATTHEW (hits Jerry to get his attention) Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat beep(fuck).JERRY The oldfashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go how do you like crotch If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.MR. TUTTLE Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients.GEORGE Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.MR. TUTTLE That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately.GEORGE I enjoy understanding.MR. TUTTLE I want you to have this job. Of course...SECRETARY Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.MR. TUTTLE Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in.GEORGE I want you to have this job. Of course...JERRY  ELAINE YeahGEORGE That's it.JERRY What do you mean that's itGEORGE He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.JERRY Of course was the last thing he saidGEORGE Maybe he was going to say Of course I have to check with my associates.ELAINE I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time.JERRY I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.GEORGE All right.ELAINE Why don't you go ahead and call himGEORGE Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.JERRY So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.GEORGE And if I don't call...JERRY You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is itGEORGE Rest stop supply.ELAINE  JERRY Oh.ELAINE Good for you.KRAMER Yeah, yeah, yeah.GEORGE HeyJERRY HeyKRAMER Hey.JERRY ShowerKRAMER Haircut.JERRY Oh.KRAMER I'm very happy with this.JERRY Who'd you use GinoKRAMER Oh course.

You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.KRAMER What bachelor auctionELAINE Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.KRAMER And you didn't ask me to do it I could raise enough money to cure polio.JERRY I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.KRAMER PolioELAINE Will you go ahead You need a haircut.JERRY Okay.KRAMER What are you all dressed up forGEORGE I had a job interview.KRAMER Yeah. How'd it goGEORGE Good.

You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal.JERRY Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)ENZO (He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you.JERRY Well I don't want to take too much off.ENZO Hey who's your barber, eh You tell the joke, I cut the hair.MAN Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.GEORGE He massacred you.JERRY I know.GEORGE You look like you're five years old.JERRY What if I shampoo Sometimes a shampoo helps.GEORGE You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.JERRY I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.GEORGE Well, you gotta do it.JERRY I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.KRAMER No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.JERRY He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.KRAMER So whatJERRY I didn't want to hurt his feelings.KRAMER His feelings You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.JERRY Yea but...KRAMER I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.JERRY No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.KRAMER I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.JERRY I don't want you to call him.KRAMER All right, geez. You're crazy.GEORGE So I still haven't heard about that job.JERRY Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about thatGEORGE I have an idea.JERRY YeahGEORGE I show up.JERRY What do you mean you show upGEORGE I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.JERRY Hmm. Not bad.GEORGE What's the worst thing that could happenJERRY Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.GEORGE Yeah, soJERRY Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.GEORGE (to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning.

They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right Oh, he was kind of quiet. I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore.[setting Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment]JERRY No eight years isn't such a long streak.ELAINE It isn'tJERRY No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.ELAINE Get outJERRY Not since June 29, 1980.ELAINE You remember the dateJERRY Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George Can you believe it I'm vomiting on June 29th again.ELAINE Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.JERRY No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of NewYork.ELAINE Yeah...

Well that's enough of that. That's enough.MICHAEL Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...ELAINE (she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him Shut up[setting Jerry's]ELAINE The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.JERRY But you like your Joel Rifkin.ELAINE Yeah.

I'm Claude Seinfeld.ELAINE Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle EighteenJERRY Yeah. Eighteen strangles.KRAMER You know why Rifkin was a serial killer Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)ELAINE You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.KRAMER I'll go.ELAINE O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.KRAMER Yeah Ooh (leaves again)ELAINE You think I should have asked GeorgeJERRY Hey did you hear that George got back with KarenELAINE KarenJERRY Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)ELAINE Oh The Risotto broad.JERRY Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.ELAINE I tought you didn't like double dates.JERRY George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.ELAINE I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.JERRY He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.ELAINE And you're taking...JERRY Jody the masseuse.ELAINE Hey, did you get a massage yetJERRY No How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massageELAINE Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.JERRY Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.ELAINE So whatJERRY So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.[setting The Chinese restaurant (the same as in 'The Chinese Restaurant')]GEORGE (George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing.

It didn't work.JODI So what's the deal with your friend GeorgeJERRY No deal. WhyJODI What was all that attractive women not getting tickets nonsenseJERRY Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.JODI I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.JERRY Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)JODI Did you see the way that he was eatingJERRY Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)JODI I have to tell you, I really don't like him.JERRY Yeah, me either.

Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.JODI You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)GEORGE Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)[setting Jerry's apartment]KRAMER (Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooozzes. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)JERRY So you had a good time.KRAMER Oh... yeah...JERRY Enjoyed yourself.KRAMER Very... much...JERRY All right now you listen and you listen good (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)KRAMER What (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)JERRY The massages are outKRAMER WhaJERRY Ahh They're outKRAMER WhyJERRY Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.KRAMER Wait a minute Wait a minute I need my massages Can't you see I'm burned outJERRY I'm sorry, Kramer.

Remy.JOEL Remy Rifkin Should I get a beretELAINE Oh, Stuart's a lot better (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.JOEL Grrrr[setting back to Jerry's]JERRY What do you mean, noJODI No means no.JERRY Look, who are you kidding You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything You're a massage teaser.JODI Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.JERRY Fine. Go.GEORGE Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, pleaseJERRY What forGEORGE We need to talk.JERRY You need to talkJODI We have nothing to talk about.GEORGE Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.JERRY George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.GEORGE (he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.JERRY WhatGEORGE She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.JERRY I can see that.JODI I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.JERRY Don't worry. (she leaves)GEORGE A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.JERRY You're a lucky guy.GEORGE I got to go after her.JERRY George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)GEORGE JODI (he starts running after her)JERRY The swedish are very big massagers. You know They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go Excuse me, I think you missed a spot.JERRY You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixtyfive'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help' 'No, just getting some air.'JERRY How would you describe the smell in this houseELAINE (sniffing) DandruffJERRY Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) KashaELAINE There's some kasha.JERRY Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.ELAINE Alright, let's go, come on.GEORGE Wha... you're goingELAINE Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.KRAMER Egh. These aren't candies.GEORGE Wha Did you use those These are guest soaps (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)KRAMER Well I'm a guest.GEORGE Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.JERRY You're not allowed to have people overGEORGE I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)KRAMER What, this is a partyELAINE Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.GEORGE (yells) Wow Who put this cup right on the new tableJERRY (picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.GEORGE But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain (he runs to kitchen)KRAMER Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huhELAINE (impatient) Come onJERRY What's the big rushELAINE I'm having people over.JERRY WhoELAINE The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...JERRY Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be thereELAINE Yeah.

(distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)GEORGE (screaming) AaahhJERRY Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)GEORGE But Jerry, this is not coming outJERRY Just put a coffee table book over it.GEORGE My parents don't read They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the tableKRAMER Hey, hey, hey, hey.

I gotta have it back before themELAINE Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.KRAMER Alright, we'll take the subway.JERRY There you go. That'll get you home in time.ELAINE Oh The subway From QueensGEORGE Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.JERRY I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.ELAINE I need something to read on the subway.JERRY (handing her a magazine) Here, read this.ELAINE (looks at it) TV GuideKRAMER Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables.

First thing in the morning.KRAMER (claps hands) Yes indeed.TANNOY (V.O.) Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.KRAMER Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want oneELAINE How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in timeKRAMER Well, they got a stand right out on the platform.

Can I come upWINONA I'll come down.KRAMER I came by to get my ball.ELAINE It's right over there.KRAMER Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip.

I'll lug.WINONA It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.JERRY And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldyaWINONA (smiling) I guess I could go for a bite.JERRY You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.MAILMAN Why must I know Because I'm Chinese You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are (adopts hackneyed Chinese accent) Oh, ask honorable Chinaman for location of restaurant.JERRY I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.MAILMAN Oh, hello American Joe.

Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.JERRY You want a gyroELAINE I don't think so.[Subway train moments later]JERRY ElaineAL ROKER Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.ELAINE He's not my boyfriend.AL ROKER He's not Interesting. (gives a big grin)JERRY I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninetyfive cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninetyfive centsJERRY You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out. I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion. After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats nopants.GEORGE Can I say one word to you Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.SASHA Twenty five dollars.GEORGE Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.SASHA George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem.GEORGE We doSASHA We cant keep seeing each other.GEORGE WhySASHA (crying) Because its over. (sob, sob, sob) Its my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me (sob)WAITER Uh, have you decided yetSASHA (crying) Yes. Ill have the lobster.GEORGE Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.JERRY Then he asked you outELAINE We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.JERRY On your heartELAINE Jerry, the man is a doctor.JERRY Doctor Hes a podiatrist.ELAINE So, its the same thing.JERRY Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.ELAINE ReallyTAWNI Hello.JERRY Oh hi.TAWNI Are you going to be stopping by laterJERRY Yes, Ill be stopping.TAWNI Ok, see you later.JERRY See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)GEORGE Its over.ELAINE WhatJERRY How did you get inGEORGE Kramer.ELAINE Whats that (points at some foil on the table)GEORGE Lobster.JERRY Looks like a swan.GEORGE She says we cant go out anymore.ELAINE WhyGEORGE Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.ELAINE Latvian Orthodox (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.JERRY Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox Too bad.GEORGE I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.JERRY Oh, whatever.ELAINE Mmm, this is delicious.JERRY Mmm, succulent.GEORGE She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.ELAINE Why dont you just ask her parentsGEORGE I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.JERRY To Latvian OrthodoxGEORGE Why not What do I careJERRY You know its not like changing toothpaste.ELAINE I think it would be romantic.GEORGE ReallyELAINE Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.GEORGE King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.JERRY Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.GEORGE You know what I could probably do this. Whats the difference.ELAINE George I was just kidding around.GEORGE No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.ELAINE George I wasnt serious.GEORGE How hard could it be You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.ELAINE I guess this one is my fault.JERRY Oh yeah.TAWNI (kiss, kiss, kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisserJERRY Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.TAWNI Well it was worth it. (kiss) Ill be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you goingJERRY To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.TAWNI Meet you back hereJERRY Right there.JERRY (thinking to himself picks up a tube) Fungicide. FungusJERRY Fungicide. I mean what could she haveELAINE I dont know.KRAMER Fungus.JERRY ExactlyELAINE So what did you sayJERRY I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.ELAINE I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinetJERRY I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.ELAINE You were snooping.JERRY I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.KRAMER I would. I always open medicine cabinets.ELAINE Well I trust people not to do that.KRAMER Big mistake.JERRY Why dont you ask that doctor what it isELAINE What Now hes a doctor Before he was a podiatrist.JERRY But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.ELAINE I am not going to ask him about funguses.KRAMER Fungi.JERRY WhatKRAMER Fungi.FATHERPRIEST Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faithGEORGE (ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)FATHERPRIEST EnigmaticGEORGE No.FATHERPRIEST Vast (he pronounces it as vost)GEORGE No not vast (he pronounces it as vost)FATHERPRIEST Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.GEORGE Yes.FATHERPRIEST 2 Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly attractiveGEORGE (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.FATHERPRIEST Are you familiar with Orthodox theologyGEORGE Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.FATHERPRIEST PlotGEORGE Yes.

I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified But I pressed on  and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. II don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine BiologistELAINE George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievableGEORGE I know I was just telling them the story.KRAMER Well come on George, finish the story.GEORGE The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deliGEORGE I got about fiftyfeet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, Easy big fella And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fishJERRY Mammal.GEORGE Whatever.KRAMER Well then, what did you do nextGEORGE Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blowhole. II, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstructionKRAMER What is that a TitleistGEORGE (Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)KRAMER A hole in one eh.JERRY Well thethe crowd must have gone wildGEORGE Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around meKRAMER (quietly) Umhm.GEORGE kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.JERRY Wow What'd she sayGEORGE Told me to Go to hell and I took the bus home.JERRY All right lets go.ELAINE What, are you in a bad moodJERRY Ahhh got my laundry back.ELAINE Ohhh Golden BoyJERRY He didn't make it.ELAINE I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)JERRY Yea. (pulls at the tshirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.KRAMER (to George) What's with youGEORGE Sand. It's everywhereKRAMER Yep.JERRY Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. What ever happened to Bob Have you seen that new Volvo commercial He's got a bulls eye right in his face. Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some promannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived.AUDREY Hum That was really goodJERRY Yeah. are you fullAUDREY Oh no, I've had just enough.JERRY Ah, here we go... apple pie Best apple pie in the city.

(still shaking)JERRY She wouldn't so much as taste it.GEORGE Did she say whyJERRY No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)GEORGE Maybe she's diabetic.JERRY No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.GEORGE Maybe you said something that offended her.JERRY The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.GEORGE Like at the airport (getting excited)JERRY Yeah.GEORGE That's a great ideaJERRY Tell me about itGEORGE We could be zipping all over the place.JERRY They could at least try it.GEORGE They never try anything.JERRY What's the harmGEORGE No harmJERRY (still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.ELAINE Who wouldn't taste a pieJERRY Audrey.ELAINE Dump her.JERRY Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pieELAINE (piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.JERRY You didELAINE He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.GEORGE Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doingELAINE I got a pebble.JERRY Boy, I never heard of that happening to a womanELAINE What the hell does that meanKRAMER Hey Elaine. Go Like this.

They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.ELAINE Get outKRAMER It's uncanny It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.GEORGE Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequinKRAMER Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...JERRY (to Kramer) Uh... may I help you (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)KRAMER It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.GEORGE Wait a minute, Rinitze Don't they have somme really cool suits in thereKRAMER Real BossELAINE I'm going down there.GEORGE I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.ELAINE (grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.GEORGE All right. All right. (They both leave)KRAMER (leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need thisJERRY Keep it. (implied please)ELAINE It looks exactly like me.GEORGE It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.ELAINE What's going on here How do you think this happenedGEORGE Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit.

That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress.ELAINE What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little eurotrash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.SALESWOMAN What is her problemGEORGE Ah, Pfft What can you do (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tagSALESWOMAN Yes.GEORGE Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)SALESWOMAN I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be halfprice.GEORGE So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for meSALESWOMAN Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.GEORGE Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)ELAINE So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.KRAMER Well, how did they get your faceELAINE I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry Je... HelloJERRY (Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.WOMAN 1 That's right.JERRY And you waved it away.WOMAN 2 Right.JERRY Did you give her a reasonWOMAN 2 Yes, I was full.JERRY You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.WOMAN 2 No, I'm not a psycho.JERRY Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip.

(tries to take off the suit from the guy)BOB Excuse me, do you work hereGEORGE (leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)BOB Then what the hell business is it of yoursGEORGE Look, I'm doing you a favor.

(Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.JERRY (pointing to napkins to Elaine) Could I get napkin over thereGEORGE It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.WAITRESS  Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.GEORGE Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)ELAINE Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.JERRY You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it.

Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.GEORGE Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.JERRY If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.GEORGE Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do somethingGEORGE Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.VICTORIA Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.GEORGE My name is George.

To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray SansABelt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.KRAMER Jerry . . .JERRY Well, it has nothing to do with you.KRAMER Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.JERRY Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.ELAINE I like Julie. She's very personable.GEORGE Yeah, she's very lovely.ELAINE That's great George.GEORGE So did you enjoy your lunchELAINE Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha WhtGEORGE oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .ELAINE Even though whatGEORGE . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the differenceELAINE What What are you trying to say, GeorgeGEORGE It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.ELAINE You want the money for the big salad, GeorgeGEORGE No, no,ELAINE What is the problemGEORGE There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.JERRY And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.MARGARET Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.JERRY Ah, no , I don't think so.MARGARET Why notJERRY We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.MARGARET Who is staringJERRY Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date.

In the dry cleaner.JERRY Newman She went out with NewmanELAINE It must be a mistake.JERRY No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand He, Newman Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing herELAINE Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.JERRY No, there's less.ELAINE It's possible.JERRY No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes.

So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.GEORGE A ha We're just friends.JULIE Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.GEORGE Oh, share.JULIE Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.GEORGE Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.JULIE Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to herGEORGE Well, she probably just assumed.JULIE Um, did sheGEORGE . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from meJULIE That's what I'm suggesting.GEORGE . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD.

And do you know why Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your gogo corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.GEORGE Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.KRAMER Hey, Bogambo  they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry.

And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBBsponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued mouths the words Woody Woodpecker.) There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.MR. PITT (to Elaine, excited) Could you identify the next song Could you Could youELAINE Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloonMR. PITT My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.ELAINE Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)DJ ON RADIO Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555BAND. (The music starts.

If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.GEORGE Neeson How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)JERRY Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.GEORGE Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.JERRY (shuts the car door) Alright, I'll change my shoes.

See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.GEORGE (to Kramer) Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)KRAMER (impressed) BossPOP Four thousand dollars We can't afford thatELECTRICIAN Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.POP But what if we can't pay for itELECTRICIAN Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.)POP 48 years, Mom And now we have to close All because of that idiot and his bloody nose (Kramer enters.)KRAMER Afternoon, Mom Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there Now, you oughta get that fixed.GEORGE SoJERRY C'mon, put the top up, it's NovemberGEORGE I feel alive, Jerry.JERRY Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.GEORGE Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencilJERRY With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what This car was owned by Jon Voight.GEORGE Ah See I told ya.JERRY Except Jon is spelled with an H. JOHN.GEORGE SoJERRY Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name JONGEORGE (pulls over) So, what are you sayingJERRY Nothing. I'm sure Jon probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I (Laughs uproariously.)GEORGE (angrily) Get out of the carJERRY WhatGEORGE That's right, you heard me. Get out You are ruining this whole experience for meJERRY (sarcastically) Oh, look There's Gregory Peck's bicycleGEORGE Get outJERRY And Barbara Mandrell's skateboardGEORGE Get out (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)TOUGH GUY (threatingly) Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah, you better runGEORGE Did they take anythingJERRY No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.GEORGE Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.JERRY You really seemed to enjoy it.GEORGE It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is JOHN, but he changed it to JON for show business. Well, you know, JON is a lot zippier.JERRY (sarcastic) Yeah, that's possible.GEORGE How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.JERRY (to Elaine) He'll dispose of it.GEORGE Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)ELAINE So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.JERRY Ah What'd you find out, LoisELAINE Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...JERRY Yeah...ELAINE And I asked him, Should Jerry bring anythingJERRY So...ELAINE Mmmm...and he said, Why would Jerry bring anythingJERRY Alright, but let me ask you this question.ELAINE WhatJERRY Which word did he emphasize Did he say, Why would Jerry bring anything or, Why would Jerry bring anything You emphasize Jerry or bring.ELAINE I think he emphasized would.JERRY You know what The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)KRAMER Hey.JERRY Hey, so where's my sneakersKRAMER That's what I wanna know.JERRY What do you meanKRAMER Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop  vrooop  vanished.JERRY So all my sneakers are goneKRAMER I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around  they didn't even have any kids.JERRY Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and PopKRAMER It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.ELAINE (amused) So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.KRAMER Apparently.ELAINE Alright, that's enough of this.JERRY Where ya goin'ELAINE I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.JERRY Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day ParadeELAINE He finds his laugh intoxicating.

MORGAN Jon Voight The actor (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.GEORGE I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.CONTEST WINNER (to Elaine) I guessed Stan Herman's Boomtown Blues. What'd you guessELAINE Um, it was, uh...Next Stop Pottersville. (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passesCONTEST WINNER After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.)KRAMER Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)VOIGHT Taxi (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi.KRAMER Hey Jon Voight Jon Voight (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)JERRY No Jon Voight Day, huhGEORGE No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurtsJERRY Yeah, it's all swollen.

Skinny Mirrors (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended  one arm for each of them  they recoil with surprise)JERRY WhatELAINE Skinny Mirrors Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.JERRY Oh, you're crazy.ELAINE Am I (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at BarneysGEORGE (to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.KRAMER Whoa.

So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.ADE Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.GEORGE Ade, you're a wonder. (he he  george laughs)ADE OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 12 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.GEORGE Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.ADE Well thank you, Im flattered.GEORGE I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.ADE Well Im just, hm, doing my job.GEORGE It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.ADE What can I say Im ...

I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.JERRY All right, all right. Im sorry.GEORGE Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.JERRY How long has she been thereGEORGE 3 days.JERRY It's almost a week.JERRY Oh, My god.GEORGE WhatJERRY It's a movie stub from the 930 show.

She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.STEINBRENNER What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter (2.25)GEORGE You know what I was just thinking  she could really use a raise.STEINBRENNER You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in.

When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies.STEINBRENNER I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.STEINBRENNER Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just cant even make up my mind. A lot of times Ill mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge.JERRY Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)KRAMER (closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.JERRY (Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The drycleaning numbers are gone too.KRAMER (grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.JERRY (grabs the ticket back) Give me that.JERRY Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)BANIA (looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys you cant do that.JERRY The ticket is worthless.BANIA You promised me.JERRY Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coatDONNA No it's not. (the coat)JERRY It is (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.DONNA No, what are you talking about.DONNA Are you out of your mind Don't you ... take your hands ...JERRY You cant have that coat, it's not yours.JERRY What do you think the drycleaners is your own personal closetELAINE Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of thisDONNA Let me see.

(reluctantly)BANIA I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying itJERRY Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)BANIA Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand JERRY (Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.BANIA Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.JERRY Oh, and who might that beBANIA Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's goodlooking. (crosses his fingers in the air)JERRY If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a onebedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.JERRY Ready to go LoisLOIS You really like to say my name Don't youJERRY Excuse me Lois.

But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.GEORGE Duncan MeyersELAINE Who's heJERRY Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.ELAINE Uh uhJERRY I was the last one on the end.

I couldn't believe it.JERRY By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.ELAINE ReallyJERRY And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed.

In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.ELAINE So now Duncan is backJERRY He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart ciderLOIS Hi.JERRY Hi.LOIS Sorry I missed the Chinese food.JERRY Oh, so am I .

The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.ELAINE It's not such a bad name.KRAMER Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm CosmoLAURA YesJERRY Hi, is Sandy hereLAURA Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come inJERRY I would except I forgot to bring a towel.LAURA (laughs nicely)JERRY So the roommate laughed at everything I said.GEORGE Wow.JERRY It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and femininenone of those big coarse ha's. You know thoseGEORGE Oh yeah HAAA, HAAA.JERRY Yeah.GEORGE Hate the big coarse ha. Hate those.JERRY And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.GEORGE I see.JERRY So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.GEORGE Well, if I hear you correctlyand I think that I domy advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.JERRY Can't be done, huhGEORGE The SwitchJERRY The Switch.GEORGE Can't be done.JERRY I wonder.GEORGE Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting itJERRY They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.GEORGE Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200somewherethere were two women living together.JERRY The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work Now what's it going to beGEORGE All right, dammit, I'm in.JERRY I couldn't do it without you.GEORGE All right. Let's get to work.GEORGE All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.JERRY Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding It's impossible It's true You can't do the Switch Nobody can do the Switch It was a stupid idea to begin with Let's face it. I'm stuck with the nonlaugher and that's thatGEORGE We'll come up with something.JERRY Yeah, sure we will.GEORGE All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)GEORGE IIIII got itGEORGE All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.JERRY All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.GEORGE That's right.JERRY And you believe this course of action will have a twopronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.GEORGE Keep going.JERRY At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.GEORGE Continue.JERRY The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.GEORGE A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.JERRY Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.GEORGE You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.JERRY It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.GEORGE (George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.KEITH Can I help youELAINE Uh, no, I'm OK.KEITH Well then what are you doing with that racquetELAINE Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.KEITH Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..ELAINE No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.KEITH Look sweetheart I don't know who you are.

Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance againKRAMER I like that eye patch.GEORGE (standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up.

He's playing all these mindgames.JERRY You're saying I'm responsible for the couchELAINE (worked up) There was nothing I could do.

So you believe, has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted disaster.ELAINE Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy.

What, is it a problemJERRY Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.ELAINE Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It has been a few years.JERRY Elaine, you always care who an exgirlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is obviously impossible.ELAINE Oh, god.JERRY The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.ELAINE Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their big, muscular arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turnoff that is.JERRY All right.GEORGE Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping todays the day.ESTELLE So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shellfish connoisseur.GEORGE You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is just torture.ESTELLE So, I'm getting an eye job.GEORGE An eye job Ma, you don't need an eye job.ESTELLE Georgie, I'm a divorcee.GEORGE No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You'reyou're a separatee.ESTELLE Well, I'm out there, George.GEORGE No, you're not out there.ESTELLE I am, tooGEORGE You're not out there You can't be, because I am out there. And if I see you out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherenceESTELLE Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.GEORGE Tuesday I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to runESTELLE This is the only time the doctor has.GEORGE Kramer, hey, hey (Gets up out of his seat)KRAMER Hi, little buddy.GEORGE Come on over and sit down.KRAMER Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.GEORGE No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...KRAMER All right, I'm sitting down.

You're out there now.GEORGE She's not out thereKRAMER So, who is your doctorESTELLE Uh, Bakersoll.KRAMER (whistles). He's good. He's very good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.GEORGE Hey, Kramer, what are you doing TuesdayKRAMER Tuesday Uh...GEORGE Why doesn't he pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.ESTELLE Oh, I don't care.KRAMER Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.GEORGE Well, giddyupKRAMER Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.CLERK Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...KRAMER All righty...CLERK Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)KRAMER (signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.CLERK What's your name againKRAMER Cosmo Kramer.CLERK (checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You are the Assman.KRAMER No I'm not the Assman.CLERK Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.DAVID How do you feelELAINE Fine.DAVID Something the matterELAINE No.DAVID Then what is itELAINE No, nothing.JERRY Hi.ELAINE I was with David Putty last night.JERRY Yeah, so.ELAINE He did the move.JERRY What moveELAINE You know...the move.JERRY Wait a second. My moveJERRY David Putty used my moveELAINE Yes, yes.JERRY Are you sureELAINE Jerry There is no confusing that move with any other move.JERRY I can't believe it. He stole my move.ELAINE What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had quite a little chatJERRY Oh, it wasn't like that I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a hightestosterone area.ELAINE Because of all the pistons and the lube jobsJERRY Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.ELAINE Well, waitwait a second.JERRY WhatELAINE Isn't that a little...rashJERRY No He stole my moveELAINE Yeah, but...I like the move.JERRY Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.ELAINE Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. Hehehe uses a pinch at the end instead of the swirlJERRY Oh, yeah. The pinch. I've done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole repertoire could be lifted.ELAINE You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.JERRY I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.JERRY ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.GEORGE You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell me I need a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.JERRY Can I just get it opened firstGEORGE I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.JERRY All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).GEORGE (takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.JERRY You feel betterGEORGE Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need something. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during lovemaking.JERRY Nancy KlopperGEORGE Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. Something. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.JERRY All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, beforeGEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.JERRY It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a conscientious way. This is not some parlor trick to be usedGEORGE You're gonna tell me...or not.JERRY All right. On your bed. You got a headboard You'll need a headboard.GEORGE I got a headboard.JERRY Is it paddedGEORGE No.JERRY Good. How tall is sheGEORGE Fivefoot four. WhyJERRY You can't have more than a onefoot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.GEORGE I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.JERRY George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.[Back at Jerry's apartment Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject]JERRY Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. I feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.GEORGE Is it a clockwise swirlJERRY I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.KRAMER Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).JERRY What is itKRAMER Fusilli Jerry It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphoneJERRY When did you do thisKRAMER In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.JERRY Oh... Why FusilliKRAMER Because you're silly. Get it (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...JERRY Well, thank you very much.GEORGE So, did you get your new platesKRAMER Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their vanity plates.GEORGE What do they sayKRAMER Assman.JERRY AssmanKRAMER Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the AssmanJERRY Who would order a license plate that says AssmanGEORGE Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.JERRY It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.KRAMER Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.JERRY Yeah. Proctologist.GEORGE Come on No doctor would put that on his car.KRAMER Have you ever met a proctologist Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. Plant yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they stuck something up there. Never It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.KRAMER Oh There's my phone. (He leaves)GEORGE So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)JERRY I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.JERRY Hey, David.DAVID Oh, hi, Jerry.JERRY Hey, what's the story I hear you're doing my move.DAVID What moveJERRY What move My move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.DAVID You're move What, are you kidding I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.JERRY The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had nothing.DAVID Oh, that ending was so obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.JERRY Swirl.DAVID Whatever. I don't even do it.JERRY Oh, yeah, I know. You do the pinch.DAVID Yeah, that's right.JERRY You can't come up with your own stuff , so you steal other peoples You're nothing but a hack.DAVID Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.JERRY Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.DAVID All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take that out of town.JERRY Fine.DAVID GoodNANCY Ow, George (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doingGEORGE (pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.NANCY Well, stop itGEORGE You don't like the moveNANCY No. I don't.GEORGE You're kidding.NANCY No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.GEORGE Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.ELAINE Oh, god Oh, god, Dave Oh, yes YesDAVID No, I'm sorry.ELAINE WhatDAVID I can't do the move.ELAINE WhatDAVID Oh, he's ruined it for me.ELAINE Oh, oh, come on, pleaseDAVID No, he called me a hack.

I don't even need bandages.ESTELLE Did he say AssmanKRAMER Oh, yeah.ESTELLE Oh my goodness.(Another car passes Hey, the Assman's in town)KRAMER You got that straightESTELLE Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.JERRY You must have done something wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirlGEORGE Supposed to close with the swirlJERRY Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.GEORGE Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.JERRY YeahBUZZER Elaine.JERRY C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.JERRY Hello Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What Twentyeight hundred dollars That's the estimate on my car No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.GEORGE What's to think about If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.JERRY Except that it's not Putty.GEORGE What happened to PuttyJERRY Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.GEORGE Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there. Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.JERRY Hey, Elaine.ELAINE Yeah, yeah, hello.JERRY Is it something I saidELAINE Yes As a matter of fact David Putty won't do the move anymore.JERRY ReallyELAINE Oh, he's come up with some other move.

You know what it's like It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes nowhere.JERRY Huh.ELAINE I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothingGEORGE Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any wayELAINE Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.GEORGE I think that's mine.ELAINE I'm not surprised.JERRY Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see himELAINE WhyJERRY You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.ELAINE An estimate How am I supposed to do thatJERRY Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out.

Whoa That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.RABBI A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.[Setting Booth at Monk's Cafe]GEORGE And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.ELAINE I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.GEORGE Ya know, I was just a little surprised.JERRY Why would anyone eat canned fruit I mean can anybody answer thatGEORGE What about all the loser stuffELAINE I don't know where the rabbi got that.

What you need is an impartial mediator.ELAINE Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for thatKRAMER Alright, I'm down.JERRY Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.ELAINE So, that's the situation.NEWMAN Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong...KRAMER NewmanNEWMAN ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you.

(standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.KRAMER No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.ELAINE Yeah, yeah, yyeah.NEWMAN Not so fast, Elaine Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yoursELAINE WhatKRAMER Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.ELAINE (frustration) But this isn't fair Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bikeKRAMER Well, tell it to the judge, honey.

Last week on Seinfeld.so far Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George has been given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine outbids SueEllen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs on behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer and Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry has to take it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When Jerry asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him.JERRY Okay, thank you.

Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this beforeDETECTIVE All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the carJERRY Had I been taking...DETECTIVE Well, did you leave the AC on Do you zip over speed bumps Do you ride the clutch Things like that.JERRY Wwell, what does it matter It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.JERRY Not that I would think of doing such things.DETECTIVE (making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything.

Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.GEORGE Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.WILHELM The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dearMRS WILHELM (O.C.)

We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.ELAINE Oh, my God.DETECTIVE And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee6 is definitely ninetytwo. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out.JERRY What is that smellDETECTIVE Look at the clutch.ELAINE Uuh.YOUNG COP Excuse me.DETECTIVE Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it.

Uh, are we, uh, almost done hereWYCK (chuckling) Oh, no, not even close.GEORGE (remorsefully) I can't go.JERRY What do you mean you can't go There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George CheeseWYCK Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value 2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by dollGEORGE You want me to find a poem about Susan May she rest in peaceWYCK Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, GeorgeGEORGE I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)WYCK PardonGEORGE (mutters it again)WYCK Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.JERRY He cleared his throatGEORGE YesJERRY SoGEORGE He did it right as he said her unfortunate accident.JERRY Not getting it.GEORGE Jerry, a throatclear is a nonverbal implication of doubt  he thinks I killed SusanJERRY Oh, help me, Rhonda.GEORGE What time is itJERRY (looks at his watch) 115.GEORGE Right nowJERRY I gotta go meet Pam.GEORGE Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'JERRY Okay. I'm just not gaga over her. For once I'd like to be gaga.GEORGE Where's ElaineJERRY She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids nowGEORGE What's with all these people having babiesJERRY Perpetuation of the species.GEORGE Yeah RightJERRY By the way, just for the record GEORGE No, I did not (They exit the coffee shop.)CAROL ...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells goodELAINE Well, that's...that's sweet.GAIL Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.CAROL Elaine, you gotta have a babyELAINE Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...LISA Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.ELAINE I really like the city.CAROL The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little AdamELAINE Uh, it was in the Hamptons.CAROL Oh I have picturesELAINE No, no, that's okay, it's uh...CAROL (shows Elaine and the girls pictures of Adam) Look at him Just look at himJERRY So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...GEORGE Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guyJERRY You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trickGEORGE Jerry LewisJERRY I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.GEORGE That's pretty paranoid.JERRY Yes, it is.GEORGE I like itJERRY I thought you might.PAM Oh, hi I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.KRAMER (mouths the words) Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)PAM Oh, careful (Jerry enters.)JERRY Hi, sorry I'm late.PAM That's okay. Kramer let me in.JERRY You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.PAM Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.KRAMER I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.NEWMAN Go on.KRAMER Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.NEWMAN Ah, yes. Forbidden love.KRAMER She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.NEWMAN Pam. I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.KRAMER I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)NEWMAN Jerry What could she possibly see in Jerry (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)KRAMER She has delicate beauty.NEWMAN Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.KRAMER And yet, he's my friend.NEWMAN And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.KRAMER Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.NEWMAN One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty  whom I fear I will never possess.KRAMER I thought we were talking about me.NEWMAN Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.KRAMER Confront Jerry I can't.NEWMAN You mustKRAMER I won'tNEWMAN You willELAINE (to Jerry, imitating Carol) Elaine, ya gotta have a baby. Ugh.GEORGE Where are all the poetry magazinesELAINE The New Yorker has poetry.GEORGE Yes. The New Yorker.JERRY Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so muchELAINE They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.JERRY C'mon, you want to have a baby.ELAINE Why Because I canJERRY It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any betterELAINE Yes I think I am better than the molluskKEVIN I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.ELAINE Oh, I'm sorry.KEVIN No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.ELAINE Yeah, like you must procreate.KEVIN Besides, anyone can do it.ELAINE Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)GEORGE I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.WYCK Are you okay, GeorgeGEORGE No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word  why. Why Susan Why wasn't it me licking those invitations Why am I still here Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)WYCK ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.)GEORGE (apologetic) Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)ELAINE So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarianKEVIN Not at all.ELAINE 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right Am I right (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...KRAMER (wipes chocolate off his face) Oh, I just had two doublefudge sundaes.ELAINE Oh. Are you alrightKRAMER Yeah, I'll be okay.ELAINE You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.KRAMER Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.ELAINE Oh, no...that won't last.KRAMER What do you meanELAINE He's not gaga.GEORGE Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis You wonder how some of these people get to the top It's ideas like this Brilliant Hahhah (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this  what the hell happened The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.JERRY How long did you leave it up thereGEORGE Five minutes. What the hell happened hereJERRY Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.GEORGE I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.JERRY Is that itGEORGE Stopped dead.JERRY What do you make of itGEORGE I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)KRAMER Jerry. Uh, can we talkGEORGE (to Kramer) Kinda busy here.KRAMER I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.GEORGE Why can't I stayKRAMER Because it doesn't concern you.GEORGE Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)JERRY So, what's on your mindKRAMER It's Pam.JERRY Pam What about PamKRAMER I love her, JerryJERRY You whatKRAMER I love herJERRY Is that rightKRAMER Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.JERRY What does that meanKRAMER Oh, and that voiceJERRY What about her nameKRAMER Pam Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. PamJERRY She's got really nice hair.KRAMER Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.JERRY You've got really specific tastes.KRAMER Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.JERRY She's got nice calves.KRAMER Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...JERRY Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.KRAMER No you can't, Jerry.JERRY But I might.KRAMER Oh, no you don't.JERRY Why not The voice The calves The baconKRAMER What...JERRY I think I can I even like the name PamKRAMER (frantic) HuhJERRY PamKRAMER HuhJERRY PamKRAMER Huhyah (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)KRAMER So now he wants her more than everNEWMAN BlastKRAMER What am I gonna do, huhNEWMAN Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.KRAMER What, again with youNEWMAN Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.KRAMER If only I could say things like that around her.NEWMAN (getting an idea) Yes...ELAINE Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...GEORGE Yes Yes, I heard the 'squink'ELAINE ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'GEORGE It's baffling, isn't itELAINE Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcaseGEORGE They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)JERRY That Pam I am gaga over herELAINE Gaga When did that happenJERRY Yesterday. Sixish.ELAINE Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty gaga myself.JERRY You just met the guy yesterday.ELAINE Yeah, but we have a common goal.JERRY A barren, sterile existence that ends when you dieELAINE (happily) Yeah.GEORGE And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.ELAINE Yeah, of course.JERRY Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.ELAINE Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.GEORGE Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, Pardon my French.JERRY I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.GEORGE I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.NEWMAN With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)PAM Oh, hi Kramer.NEWMAN (whispers through the bookcase) Hi. How are youKRAMER Hi. How are youPAM I'm great.NEWMAN I too am well.KRAMER I too am well.NEWMAN Do I smell PanteneKRAMER Do I smellNEWMAN PanteneKRAMER Uh, Pantene.PAM Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.KRAMER (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with Newman) Well, there really is no junkmail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...NEWMAN (frantic) ...it takes just as much manpower to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...KRAMER Newman (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)PAM WhatKRAMER Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.PAM That's so true.KRAMER Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...NEWMAN Shell.KRAMER ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.PAM Kramer, that is so lovely.KRAMER It's by an unknown 20thcentury poet.PAM Oh, what's his nameKRAMER Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)KEVIN Elaine, you've changed my life.ELAINE Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.KEVIN I got a vasectomy this morning.ELAINE Although, I have a hunch you mean it.JERRY I just came by to tell you  I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.PAM Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.)JERRY's brain A velvet scrunchieJERRY KramerJERRY Hello, Newman.NEWMAN Hello, Jerry. How's PamJERRY Pam What do you care (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)NEWMAN Well, tata (Scampers away.)JERRY Wait a minute (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)JERRY Alright, Newman This is it (Shoves him against the wall.)NEWMAN (sweating) Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.JERRY Why notNEWMAN Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)JERRY (rolls his eyes) C'mon. (They exit.)JERRY I can't believe I'm losing PamNEWMAN I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.JERRY I thought we were talking about me.NEWMAN Right.JERRY Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)NEWMAN Oh, don't you Joke boy You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the halfsoused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane observationsJERRY Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for KramerNEWMAN Well, there is a little something you can do for me...JERRY C'mon, out with it.NEWMAN It's about...Elaine.JERRY Elaine What does she have to  (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...NEWMAN You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can useJERRY (shrugs) Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)KEVIN I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.ELAINE I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.KEVIN What was thatELAINE Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.KEVIN This is Oh boy, I always do this.ELAINE WhatKEVIN Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.ELAINE ReallyKEVIN Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jetskis. 4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.ELAINE You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...KEVIN Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kidsELAINE Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.KEVIN Yeah I think I like short hair. Really short.ELAINE YeahKEVIN YeahGEORGE This is a crude mockup of the conference room. 114th scale.JERRY When did you build this thingGEORGE Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...JERRY (points at the Power Ranger) Wait, that's youGEORGE Yeah.JERRY (picks up a yellow MM toy from the model) I really think the MM should be you.GEORGE (grabs the MM away from Jerry) Alright, whatever Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.JERRY AndGEORGE Okay. That's what we know.JERRY But we already knew that.GEORGE Well, yeah.JERRY Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.GEORGE I don't know if you're ready for it.JERRY Please.GEORGE I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never JERRY Hold it, hold it You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) YeahVOICE ON SPEAKER It's Pam.JERRY C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'GEORGE I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)PAM What was thatJERRY We were just playin.'PAM Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...JERRY Uh huh...PAM Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.)KRAMER I'm so happy My world suddenly has meaningJERRY (to Pam) This is the man you have a crush onPAM Well, I have feelings for both of you.KRAMER How can you have feelings for him We're soul mates.JERRY Why can't I be a soul mateKRAMER Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her childrenPAM Children Who said anything about children I don't want to have children.GEORGE There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain And this tape recorder.WYCK George...GEORGE You'll have your turn The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...Dear God Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.WYCK George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorderGEORGE Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.ELAINE What are you guys doing hereJERRY We're getting vasectomies.ELAINE WhyNEWMAN (to Elaine) I'm doing it for you.ELAINE WhatJERRY (to Elaine) What'd you do to your hairELAINE I cut it.JERRY It's a little short.KEVIN Y'thinkJERRY (to Kevin) What are you doing hereELAINE Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.JERRY and NEWMAN Reversed (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)GEORGE ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.WYCK Is that a Keats poemGEORGE No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)WYCK Does anyone think George might have murdered SusanMR. CROSS Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.MS. BAINES Of course he killed her.WYCK So it's not just me, then. Alright Back to business.JERRY All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.GEORGE Fine.JERRY They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circusGEORGE I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.JERRY But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planetGEORGE I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..JERRY (resigned) At least it's show business..GEORGE But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.JERRY What if she's got no interest in youGEORGE Wthen I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.[Exterior long shot looking up at an office building Interior of office reception area of BrandLeland as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in.

It's under the couch.KRAMER Look at you You've got another gig Uhh.JERRY I don't want another gig I'm not doin' this.KRAMER But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act.

(All workers laugh)ELAINE What What is so funnyANNA Sorry, I got hung up.ELAINE At Yankee StadiumANNA This It's mine.ELAINE Oh really 'Cause it looks a little big for you.

Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)JERRY No, no, no, no, no, no, no What were you thinking when you shot thisKRAMER That's fine.JERRY Do you even know what this scene is aboutKRAMER It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.JERRY No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.KRAMER Wha WhereJERRY Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.KRAMER Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.JERRY I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.KRAMER So you'll do the movie (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot  we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')JERRY I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markersKRAMER Right here. (Elaine enters)ELAINE Well, I have lost complete control of my staff.

(He tries to get away)ELAINE Jerry, do I stinkJERRY All right, you're beyond stink.ELAINE But I really enjoy dancing.JERRY And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.ELAINE It's that badJERRY Have you ever seen yourself (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.VOICE I have George Costanza still holding.ELAINE George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.GEORGE Yo, Anna.ANNA Hi, George. What're you up toGEORGE (Ironing) You don't wanna know.ELAINE Uh, well, listen.

I wanna be able to talk to 'em.BRODY Are you out of your mindJERRY Kramer...KRAMER I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.BRODY Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the streetJERRY All right. That's it, I can't work like this.KRAMER Jerry...JERRY I'm off the project. (He exits)KRAMER JerryBRODY I want the tape.KRAMER Yeah.GEORGE Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe thatJERRY They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.GEORGE Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughssnorts) It's all over.JERRY Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)KRAMER Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me.

You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it.GEORGE Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that (Elaine enters)ELAINE Anna...ANNA Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up.

I worked with him on Fortyeighth and Sixth.CLICKY Yeah, that's where he come up with it.JERRY In his dreams.ELAINE Alright, can we (glances at her watch) goJERRY (to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.JERRY It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.GEORGE (pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.JERRY (as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.KRAMER Hey. Well.

They just cleaned the carpets and left.

Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as giftgivers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.JERRY Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.KRAMER Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmmKRAMER That's right.GEORGE How'd you hook up with these guysKRAMER Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.JERRY What kind of show am I gonna do in JapanKRAMER (to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.GEORGE (excited) Yeah, the pilotKRAMER That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.GEORGE (enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New YorkJERRY Forget it The pilot was awful. It failed.GEORGE (animated) It failed here Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their datesKRAMER George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.TV JERRY You had a date You went out with my butler Who said you could go out with my butlerTV ELAINE Well, why do I need your permissionTV JERRY Because he's my butler.GEORGE (eager) So What d'you thinkEXECUTIVE 1 We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butlerGEORGE Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.EXECUTIVE 1 Is this customary in your legal systemJERRY No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.EXECUTIVE 1 (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Are you following any of thisEXECUTIVE 2 (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.EXECUTIVE 1 (to Jerry and George) I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.GEORGE Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.EXECUTIVE 1 (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Again with the orangesJERRY (flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.GEORGE (positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)EXECUTIVE 1 You must go now.ELAINE Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.JERRY (throws out his hands) What does he listen to The all Desperado stationELAINE He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.JERRY You know, what you need is a song you can share.ELAINE Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.JERRY Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly aboutELAINE (points) I like Witchy Woman.JERRY Witchy WomanELAINE You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Oooooh, witchay woman'.JERRY (getting it) Ahh.

My guests are very comfortable in them.ELAINE In themJERRY You have them sleeping in drawersKRAMER Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time.

That could be our song.BRETT Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.ELAINE Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado (smiling) We can share it.BRETT (flat) No. It's mine.KRAMER Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.KRAMER (loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.MR OH (O.C.)

In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.JACKIE Rugged The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days.

Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. JaneWELLS Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.RIVERA What's the mood What's going on tonightWELLS Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.RIVERA And what about the defendants  the socalled New York Four. How are they holding upWELLS Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote There's no love lost with that group.RIVERA Anything else, JaneWELLS There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.RIVERA Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.HELEN I hope you packed enough  this trial could last for weeks.MORTY What's all thatHELEN Cereal.MORTY You're packing cerealHELEN I'm bringing it for Jerry.MORTY You got enough here for a life sentence.HELEN He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.MORTY So bring a snackpack.ESTELLE Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him Did we do something wrong Maybe it was our fault.FRANK Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.ESTELLE Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.FRANK You were the one who smothered him.ESTELLE I did not smother him.FRANK You smothered He couldn't get any air He couldn't breathe He was suffocatingESTELLE Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.FRANK I had to make a livingKRAMER This is excellent huh Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.JERRY You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters  sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.KRAMER I bet.JERRY It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.CHILES Good morning.ELAINE Good morning, Jackie.JERRY Good morning.CHILES Is everybody ready Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardiganGEORGE It makes me look older.CHILES Look older Do you think this is a game Is that what you think this is I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.CHILES Do you think it's funnyJERRY No.CHILES You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smartalecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie.

Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding.GEORGE Vandelay The judge's name is VandelayCHILES Vanda whoGEORGE Jerry, did you hear thatJERRY Yeah.GEORGE I think that's a good sign.VANDELAY Is the District Attorney ready to proceedHOYT We are, Your Honor.VANDELAY Mr. Hoyt.HOYT Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, selfabsorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.VANDELAY Mr. Chiles.CHILES I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing  lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal  the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.VANDELAY Is the prosecution ready to present its first witnessHOYT We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.BAILIFF Call Matt Vogel.HOYT So they were just standing thereVOGEL Yes.HOYT Did one of them have a video cameraVOGEL Yes.HOYT Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.VANDELAY Proceed.VOGEL Don't shoot.JERRY Well, there goes the money for the lipo.ELAINE See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway.

I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.HOYT Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of antisocial behavior that's been going on for years.VANDELAY Objection overruled.

Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane WELLS Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.RIVERA That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.WELLS Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.RIVERA Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this juryWELLS That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.RIVERA And so we wait.JERRY Do they make you wear uniforms in prisonELAINE I think so.JERRY It's not that bright orange one is itELAINE I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.KRAMER Will you stop worrying Jackie's going to get us off.

This jury could be out for days.CHILES Hello Damn. They're ready.JERRY Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going downELAINE I've always loved ... United Airlines.KRAMER I think it's going to be okay  that girl just smiled at me.JERRY Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.BAILIFF All rise.VANDELAY Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdictFOREMAN We have, Your Honor.VANDELAY Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifferenceFOREMAN We find the defendants  guilty.VANDELAY Order Order in this court, I will clear this room I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.GEORGE You had to hop You had to hop on the plane.ELAINE Puddy, don't wait for me.PUDDY Alright.FRANK We gotta get out of here.

The prison call is like the king of calls.JERRY I think that would be a very nice gesture.KRAMER I got it  it's out How about that, huh Oh, boy, what a relief.JERRY See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.GEORGE ReallyJERRY Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in noman's land.GEORGE Haven't we had this conversation beforeJERRY You thinkGEORGE I think we have.JERRY Yeah, maybe we have.JERRY So what is the deal with the yard I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown Why do we have to be locked in our cells Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock DPRISONER 1 I am.JERRY I'll talk slower. I'm kidding  I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sirPRISONER 2 Murder one.JERRY Murder one Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir  lighten up. How about you, what are you in forPRISONER 3 Grand theft auto.JERRY Grand theft auto  don't steal any of my jokes.PRISONER 3 You suck  I'm gonna cut you.JERRY Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.GUARD Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.JERRY Alright, hey, you've been great See you in the cafeteria.'\">"
